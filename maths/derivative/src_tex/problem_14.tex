Below are the problems with their respective tasks from the given document:

1. **Find the differential coefficient or derivative of following functions with respect to \(x\)**:
   - \( \sin(x^3) \)
   - \( x \sin x \)
   - \( \frac{\ln x}{x} \)
   - \( \tan^{-1} x \)
   - \( x \ln(\sin(x^2)) \)
   - \( \sin^3 x \)
   - \( \sin \left( \sqrt{x + \sqrt{x}} \right) \)

2. Given \( y = x + 3; x = t^2 + 4; t = u^2 - u + 1 \), find \(\frac{dy}{du}\) as a function of \(u\).

3. Given \(\sin(x + y) = \ln x\), find \(\frac{dy}{dx}\).

4. Discuss the continuity and differentiability of the following function:
   \[ 
   f(x) = 
   \begin{cases} 
   x^2 - 4, & x \geq 0 \\
   -(x - 2)^2, & x < 0 
   \end{cases}
   \]

5. **The distance \( S(t) \) traveled by a particle during time interval \(0\) to \(t\) is given by \( S(t) = t^3 + t \)**. Find:
   - (a) Average speed of the particle during the time interval \( t = 1 \) to \( t = 2 \).
   - (b) Instantaneous speed of the particle at \( t = 0, 1, \text{ and } 2 \).

6. **The positions of a particle moving in space vary with time \( t \) according as \( x = t + 2; y = t^2 - t; z = t^3 + 1 \)**. Find:
   - (a) \( \frac{dy}{dx} \) as a function of \( t \)
   - (b) \( \frac{dx}{dz} \) as a function of \( t \)
   - (c) \( \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} \) as a function of \( t \)
   - (d) \( \frac{d^3z}{dx^3} \) as a function of \( t \)

7. **Give an example of a function \( f(x) \) such that**:
   - (a) \( f'(x) = f(x) \)
   - (b) \( f'(x) = -f(x) \)
   - (c) \( f''(x) = f(x) \)
   - (d) \( f''(x) = -f(x) \)
   - (e) \( f''(x) = 0 \)

These questions cover the concepts of differentiation and differentiability, including rules and applications of derivatives in various contexts such as physics with particle movement.

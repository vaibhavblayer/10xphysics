\item A block of mass \(2 \, \text{kg}\) is free to move along the x-axis. It is at rest and from \( t = 0 \) onwards it is subjected to a time-dependent force \( F(t) \) in the x direction. The force \( F(t) \) varies with \( t \) as shown in the figure. The kinetic energy of the block after \( 4.5 \) seconds is

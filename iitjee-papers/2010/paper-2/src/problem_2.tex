\item A hollow pipe of length \(0.8 \, \mathrm{m}\) is closed at one end. At its open end a \(0.5 \, \mathrm{m}\) long uniform string is vibrating in its second harmonic and it resonates with the fundamental frequency of the pipe. If the tension in the wire is \(50 \, \mathrm{N}\) and the speed of sound is \(320 \, \mathrm{ms^{-1}}\), the mass of the string is

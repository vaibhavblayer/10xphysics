\item Incandescent bulbs are designed by keeping in mind that the resistance of their filament increases with the increase in temperature. If at room temperature, 100 W, 60 W and 40 W bulbs have filament resistances \( R_{100} \), \( R_{60} \), and \( R_{40} \) respectively, the relation between these resistances is
    \begin{tasks}(2)
        \task \( \frac{1}{R_{100}} = \frac{1}{R_{40}} + \frac{1}{R_{60}} \)
        \task \( R_{100} = R_{40} + R_{60} \)
        \task \( R_{100} > R_{60} > R_{40} \)
        \task \( \frac{1}{R_{100}} > \frac{1}{R_{60}} > \frac{1}{R_{40}} \)
    \end{tasks}
    \begin{solution}
        \begin{align*}
            \intertext{For incandescent bulbs, power $P$ is related to resistance $R$ by the formula $P=\frac{V^2}{R}$ where $V$ is the voltage.}
            R_{100}&=\frac{V^2}{100},\\
            R_{60}&=\frac{V^2}{60},\\
            R_{40}&=\frac{V^2}{40}.\\
            \intertext{Comparing the resistances, we get:}
            R_{100}&<R_{60}<R_{40}.\\
            \intertext{Thus, option (c) \( R_{100} > R_{60} > R_{40} \) is correct.}
        \end{align*}
    \end{solution}

\item A student uses a simple pendulum of exactly 1m length to determine \( g \), the acceleration due to gravity. He uses a stop watch with the least count of 1 sec for this and records 40 seconds for 20 oscillations. For this observation, which of the following statement(s) is (are) true?
    \begin{tasks}(2)
        \task Error \( \Delta T \) in measuring \( T \), the time period, is 0.05 seconds
        \task Error \( \Delta T \) in measuring \( T \), the time period, is 1 second
        \task Percentage error in the determination of \( g \) is 5\%
        \task Percentage error in the determination of \( g \) is 2.5\%
    \end{tasks}

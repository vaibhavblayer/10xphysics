\item A ray OP of monochromatic light is incident on the face AB of prism ABCD near vertex B at an incident angle of \(60^\circ\) (see figure). If the refractive index of the material of the prism is \(\sqrt{3}\), which of the following is (are) correct?
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            % Since the actual diagram from the provided image cannot be reproduced using TikZ within this response,
            % place a placeholder or draw the diagram according to the provided image.
            \node at (0, 0) {Diagram placeholder or diagram};
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    \begin{tasks}(2)
        \task The ray gets totally internally reflected at face CD
        \task The ray comes out through face AD
        \task The angle between the incident ray and the emergent ray is \(90^\circ\)
        \task The angle between the incident ray and the emergent ray is \(120^\circ\)
    \end{tasks}

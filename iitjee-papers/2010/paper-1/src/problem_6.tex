\item A thin flexible wire of length \( L \) is connected to two adjacent fixed points and carries a current \( I \) in the clockwise direction, as shown in the figure. When the system is put in a uniform magnetic field of strength \( B \) going into the plane of the paper, the wire takes the shape of a circle. The tension in the wire is

\item Consider a thin square sheet of side \( L \) and thickness \( t \), made of a material of resistivity \( \rho \). The resistance between two opposite faces, shown by the shaded areas in the figure is
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \draw[thick, pattern=north east lines] (0,0) rectangle (1.5,1.5);
            \draw[<->] (1.6,0) -- (1.6,1.5) node[midway,right] {\(t\)};
            \draw[<->] (0,-0.2) -- (1.5,-0.2) node[midway,below] {\(L\)};
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

        \task independent of \( L \)
        \task independent of \( t \)
    \end{tasks}

\item Gravitational acceleration on the surface of a planet is $\sqrt{\frac{6}{11}} g$, where $g$ is the gravitational acceleration on the surface of the earth. The average mass density of the planet is $\frac{2}{3}$ times that of the earth. If the escape speed on the surface of the earth is taken to be $11 \text{ kms}^{-1}$, the escape speed on the surface of the planet in $\text{kms}^{-1}$ will be \underline{\hspace{2.5cm}}.

\item A piece of ice (heat capacity \( = 2100 \ J \ kg^{-1} \ ^{\circ}C^{-1} \) and latent heat \( = 3.36 \times 10^{5} \ J \ kg^{-1} \)) of mass \( m \) grams is at \( -5^{\circ}C \) at atmospheric pressure. It is given \( 420 \ J \) of heat so that the ice starts melting. Finally, when the ice-water mixture is in equilibrium, it is found that \( 1 \ gm \) of ice has melted. Assuming there is no other heat exchange in the process, the value of \( m \) is \underline{\hspace{2.5cm}}.

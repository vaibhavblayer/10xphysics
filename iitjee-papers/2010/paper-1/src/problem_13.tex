\item One mole of an ideal gas in initial state A undergoes a cyclic process ABCA, as shown in the figure. Its pressure at A is \( P_0 \). Choose the correct option(s) from the following
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            % The diagram should be created according to the actual figure.
            % Below is a placeholder for the diagram.
            \node at (0, 0) {Diagram};
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    \begin{tasks}(2)
        \task Internal energies at A and B are the same
        \task Work done by the gas in process AB is \( \frac{P_0 V_0}{4} \)
        \task Pressure at C is \( \frac{P_0}{4} \)
        \task Temperature at C is \( \frac{T_0}{4} \)
    \end{tasks}

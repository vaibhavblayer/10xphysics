\item A block of mass $m$ is on an inclined plane of angle $\theta$. The coefficient of friction between the block and the plane is $\mu$ and $\tan{\theta} > \mu$. The block is held stationary by applying a force $P$ parallel to the plane. The direction of force pointing up the plane is taken to be positive. As $P$ is varied from $P_1 = mg(\sin{\theta} - \mu \cos{\theta})$ to $P_2 = mg(\sin{\theta} + \mu \cos{\theta})$, the frictional force $f$ versus $P$ graph will look like

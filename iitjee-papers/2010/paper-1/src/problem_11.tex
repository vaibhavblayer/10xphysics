\item A point mass of \(1 \, \text{kg}\) collides elastically with a stationary point mass of \(5 \, \text{kg}\). After their collision, the \(1 \, \text{kg}\) mass reverses its direction and moves with a speed of \(2 \, \text{ms}^{-1}\). Which of the following statement(s) is (are) correct for the system of these two masses?
    \begin{tasks}(2)
        \task Total momentum of the system is \(3 \, \text{kg ms}^{-1}\)
        \task Momentum of \(5 \, \text{kg}\) mass after collision is \(4 \, \text{kg ms}^{-1}\)
        \task Kinetic energy of the centre of mass is \(0.75 \, \text{J}\)
        \task Total kinetic energy of the system is \(4 \, \text{J}\)
    \end{tasks}

\item When two identical batteries of internal resistance \(1 \Omega\) each are connected in series across a resistor \(R\), the rate of heat produced in \(R\) is \(J_1\). When the same batteries are connected in parallel across \(R\), the rate is \(J_2\). If \(J_1 = 2.25 J_2\), then the value of \(R\) in \(\Omega\) is \underline{\hspace{2.5cm}}.

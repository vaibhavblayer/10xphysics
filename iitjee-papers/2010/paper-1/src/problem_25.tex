\item A binary star consists of two stars A (mass \(2.2M_{\odot}\)) and B (mass \(11M_{\odot}\)), where \(M_{\odot}\) is the mass of the sun. They are separated by distance \(d\) and are rotating about their centre of mass, which is stationary. The ratio of the total angular momentum of the binary star to the angular momentum of star B about the centre of mass is \underline{\hspace{2.5cm}}.

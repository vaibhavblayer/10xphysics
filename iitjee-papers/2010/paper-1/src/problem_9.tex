\item A few electric field lines for a system of two charges \( q_1 \) and \( q_2 \), fixed at two different points on the x-axis are shown in the figure. These lines suggest that
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \node at (0, 0) {Diagram};
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    \begin{tasks}(2)
        \task \( |q_1| > |q_2| \)
        \task \( |q_1| < |q_2| \)
        \task at a finite distance to the left of \( q_1 \), the electric field is zero
        \task at a finite distance to the right of \( q_2 \), the electric field is zero
    \end{tasks}

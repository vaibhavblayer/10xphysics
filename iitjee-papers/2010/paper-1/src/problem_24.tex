\item A \(0.1\,kg\) mass is suspended from a wire of negligible mass. The length of the wire is \(1\,m\) and its cross-sectional area is \(4.9\times10^{-7}\,m^2\). If the mass is pulled a little in the vertically downward direction and released, it performs simple harmonic motion of angular frequency \(140\,rad\,s^{-1}\). If the Young's modulus of the material of the wire is \(n\times10^9\,Nm^{-2}\), the value of \(n\) is \underline{\hspace{2.5cm}}.

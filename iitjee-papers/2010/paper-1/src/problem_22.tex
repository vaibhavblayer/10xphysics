\item Two spherical bodies A (radius 6 cm) and B (radius 18 cm) are at temperatures \(T_1\) and \(T_2\), respectively. The maximum intensity in the emission spectrum of A is at 500 nm and in that of B is at 1500 nm. Considering them to be black bodies, what will be the ratio of the rate of total energy radiated by A to that of B? \underline{\hspace{2.5cm}}.

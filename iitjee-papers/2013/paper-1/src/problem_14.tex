\item Two non-conducting solid spheres of radii \( R \) and \( 2R \), having uniform volume charge densities \( \rho_1 \) and \( \rho_2 \) respectively, touch each other. The net electric field at a distance \( 2R \) from the centre of the smaller sphere, along the line joining the centres of the spheres, is zero. The ratio \( \frac{\rho_1}{\rho_2} \) can be

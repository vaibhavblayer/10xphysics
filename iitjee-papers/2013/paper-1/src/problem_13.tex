\item A particle of mass \( M \) and positive charge \( Q \), moving with a constant velocity \( \vec{u}_1 = 4\hat{i} \, \text{ms}^{-1} \), enters a region of uniform static magnetic field normal to the \( xy \)-plane. The region of the magnetic field extends from \( x = 0 \) to \( x = L \) for all values of \( y \). After passing through this region, the particle emerges on the other side after 10 milliseconds with a velocity \( \vec{u}_2 = 2(\sqrt{3}\hat{i} + \hat{j}) \, \text{ms}^{-1} \). The correct statement(s) is (are)
    \begin{tasks}(2)
        \task The direction of the magnetic field is \(-z\) direction.
        \task The direction of the magnetic field is \(+z\) direction.
        \task The magnitude of the magnetic field is \( \frac{50 \pi M}{3Q} \) units.
        \task The magnitude of the magnetic field is \( \frac{100 \pi M}{3Q} \) units.

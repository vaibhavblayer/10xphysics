    \item A bob of mass \( m \), suspended by a string of length \( l_1 \), is given a minimum velocity 
    required to complete a full circle in the vertical plane. At the highest point, it collides 
    elastically with another bob of mass \( m \) suspended by a string of length \( l_2 \), which is 
    initially at rest. Both the strings are mass-less and inextensible. If the second bob, 
    after collision acquires the minimum speed required to complete a full circle in the 
    vertical plane, the ratio \( \frac{l_1}{l_2} \) is \underline{\hspace{2.5 cm}}.

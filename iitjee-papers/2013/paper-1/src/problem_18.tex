    \item A particle of mass \(0.2\ \text{kg}\) is moving in one dimension under a force that delivers a constant power \(0.5\ \text{W}\) to the particle. If the initial speed (in \(\text{ms}^{-1}\)) of the particle is zero, the speed (in \(\text{ms}^{-1}\)) after \(5\ \text{s}\) is \underline{\hspace{2.5 cm}}.

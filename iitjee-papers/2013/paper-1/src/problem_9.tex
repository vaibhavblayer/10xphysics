\item One end of a horizontal thick copper wire of length $2L$ and radius $2R$ is welded to an end of another horizontal thin copper wire of length $L$ and radius $R$. When the arrangement is stretched by applying forces at two ends, the ratio of the elongation in the thin wire to that in the thick wire is

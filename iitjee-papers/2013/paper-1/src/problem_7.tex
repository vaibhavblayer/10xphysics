\item A particle of mass \(m\) is projected from the ground with an initial speed \(u_0\), at an angle \(\alpha\) with the horizontal. At the highest point of its trajectory, it makes a completely inelastic collision with another identical particle, which was thrown vertically upward from the ground with the same initial speed \(u_0\). The angle that the composite system makes with the horizontal immediately after the collision is

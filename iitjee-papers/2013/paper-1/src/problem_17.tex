    \item A freshly prepared sample of a radioisotope of half-life 1386 s has activity \(10^3\) disintegrations per second. Given that \(\ln 2 = 0.693\), the fraction of the initial number of nuclei (expressed in nearest integer percentage) that will decay in the first 80 s after preparation of the sample is \underline{\hspace{2.5 cm}}.

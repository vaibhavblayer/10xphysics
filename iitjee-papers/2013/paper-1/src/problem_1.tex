\item The diameter of a cylinder is measured using a Vernier callipers with no zero error. It is found that the zero of the Vernier scale lies between \(5.10 \, \text{cm}\) and \(5.15 \, \text{cm}\) of the main scale. The Vernier scale has \(50\) divisions equivalent to \(2.45 \, \text{cm}\). The \(24^{th}\) division of the Vernier scale exactly coincides with one of the main scale divisions. The diameter of the cylinder is

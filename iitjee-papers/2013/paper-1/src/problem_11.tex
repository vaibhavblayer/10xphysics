\item A horizontal stretched string, fixed at two ends, is vibrating in its fifth harmonic according to the equation, $y(x, t) = (0.01\, m) \sin [(62.8\, m^{-1}) x] \cos [(628\, s^{-1})t]$. Assuming $\pi = 3.14$, the correct statement(s) is (are)
        \begin{tasks}(2)
            \task The number of nodes is 5.
            \task The length of the string is 0.25 m.
            \task The maximum displacement of the midpoint of the string, from its equilibrium position is 0.01 m.
            \task The fundamental frequency is 100 Hz.

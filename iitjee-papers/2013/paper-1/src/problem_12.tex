\item A solid sphere of radius $R$ and density $\rho$ is attached to one end of a mass-less spring of force constant $k$. The other end of the spring is connected to another solid sphere of radius $R$ and density $3\rho$. The complete arrangement is placed in a liquid of density $2\rho$ and is allowed to reach equilibrium. The correct statement(s) is (are)
    \begin{tasks}(2)
        \task the net elongation of the spring is $\frac{4\pi R^3 \rho g}{3k}$.
        \task the net elongation of the spring is $\frac{8\pi R^3 \rho g}{3k}$.
        \task the light sphere is partially submerged.
        \task the light sphere is completely submerged.
    \end{tasks}

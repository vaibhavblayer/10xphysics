\item Two vehicles, each moving with speed \( u \) on the same horizontal straight road, are approaching each other. Wind blows along the road with velocity \( w \). One of these vehicles blows a whistle of frequency \( f_1 \). An observer in the other vehicle hears the frequency of the whistle to be \( f_2 \). The speed of sound in still air is \( V \). The correct statement(s) is (are)
    \begin{tasks}(1)
        \task If the wind blows from the observer to the source, \( f_2 > f_1 \).
        \task If the wind blows from the source to the observer, \( f_2 > f_1 \).
        \task If the wind blows from observer to the source, \( f_2 < f_1 \).
        \task If the wind blows from the source to the observer, \( f_2 < f_1 \).
    \end{tasks}

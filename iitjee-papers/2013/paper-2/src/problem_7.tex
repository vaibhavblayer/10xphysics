\item A steady current $I$ flows along an infinitely long hollow cylindrical conductor of radius $R$. This cylinder is placed coaxially inside an infinite solenoid of radius $2R$. The solenoid has $n$ turns per unit length and carries a steady current $I$. Consider a point $P$ at a distance $r$ from the common axis. The correct statement(s) is (are)
    \begin{tasks}(1)
        \task In the region $0 < r < R$, the magnetic field is non-zero.
        \task In the region $R < r < 2R$, the magnetic field is along the common axis.
        \task In the region $R < r < 2R$, the magnetic field is tangential to the circle of radius $r$, centered on the axis.
        \task In the region $r > 2R$, the magnetic field is non-zero.
    \end{tasks}

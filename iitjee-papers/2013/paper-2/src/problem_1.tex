\item Using the expression \(2d \sin \theta = \lambda\), one calculates the values of \(d\) by measuring the corresponding angles \(\theta\) in the range \(0\) to \(90^\circ\). The wavelength \(\lambda\) is exactly known and the error in \(\theta\) is constant for all values of \(\theta\). As \(\theta\) increases from \(0^\circ\),
    \begin{tasks}(1)
        \task the absolute error in \(d\) remains constant.
        \task the absolute error in \(d\) increases.
        \task the fractional error in \(d\) remains constant.
        \task the fractional error in \(d\) decreases.
    \end{tasks}

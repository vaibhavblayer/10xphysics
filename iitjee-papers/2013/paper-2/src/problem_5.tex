\item Two bodies, each of mass \( M \), are kept fixed with a separation \( 2L \). A particle of mass \( m \) is projected from the midpoint of the line joining their centres, perpendicular to the line. The gravitational constant is \( G \). The correct statement(s) is (are)
    \begin{tasks}(1)
        \task The minimum initial velocity of the mass \( m \) to escape the gravitational field of the two bodies is \( 4\sqrt{\frac{GM}{L}} \).
        \task The minimum initial velocity of the mass \( m \) to escape the gravitational field of the two bodies is \( 2\sqrt{\frac{GM}{L}} \).
        \task The minimum initial velocity of the mass \( m \) to escape the gravitational field of the two bodies is \( \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{L}} \).
        \task The energy of the mass \( m \) remains constant.
    \end{tasks}

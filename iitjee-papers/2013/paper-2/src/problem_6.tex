\item A particle of mass \( m \) is attached to one end of a mass-less spring of force constant \( k \), lying on a frictionless horizontal plane. The other end of the spring is fixed. The particle starts moving horizontally from its equilibrium position at time \( t = 0 \) with an initial velocity \( u_0 \). When the speed of the particle is \( 0.5 u_0 \), it collides elastically with a rigid wall. After this collision,
    \begin{tasks}(1)
        \task the speed of the particle when it returns to its equilibrium position is \( u_0 \).
        \task the time at which the particle passes through the equilibrium position for the first time is \( t = \pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}} \).
        \task the time at which the maximum compression of the spring occurs is \( t = \frac{4\pi}{3} \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}} \).
        \task the time at which the particle passes through the equilibrium position for the second time is \( t = \frac{5\pi}{3} \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}} \).
    \end{tasks}

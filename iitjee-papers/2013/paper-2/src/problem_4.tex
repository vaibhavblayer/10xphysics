\item The radius of the orbit of an electron in a Hydrogen-like atom is \(4.5 a_0\), where \(a_0\) is the Bohr radius. Its orbital angular momentum is \(\frac{3h}{2\pi}\). It is given that \(h\) is Planck constant and \(R\) is Rydberg constant. The possible wavelength(s), when the atom de-excites, is (are)

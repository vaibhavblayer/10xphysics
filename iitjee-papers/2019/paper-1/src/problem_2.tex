\begin{enumerate}
    \item A thin spherical insulating shell of radius \( R \) carries a uniformly distributed charge such that the potential at its surface is \( V_0 \). A hole with a small area \( a4\pi R^2 \) ( \( \alpha \ll 1 \)) is made on the shell without affecting the rest of the shell. Which one of the following statements is correct?
        \begin{tasks}(2)
            \task The potential at the center of the shell is reduced by \( 2\alpha V_0 \)
            \task The magnitude of electric field at the center of the shell is reduced by \( \frac{\alpha V_0}{2R} \)
            \task The ratio of the potential at the center of the shell to that of the point at \( \frac{1}{2} R \) from center towards the hole will be \( \frac{1-\alpha}{1-2\alpha} \)
            \task The magnitude of electric field at a point, located on a line passing through the hole and shellâ€™s center, on a distance \( 2R \) from the center of the spherical shell will be reduced by \( \frac{\alpha V_0}{2R} \)
        \end{tasks}
\end{enumerate}

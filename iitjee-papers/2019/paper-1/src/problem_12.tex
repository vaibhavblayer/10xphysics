\begin{enumerate}
    \item Two identical moving coil galvanometers have 10 $\Omega$ resistance and full scale deflection at 2 $\mu$A current. One of them is converted into a voltmeter of 100 mV full scale reading and the other into an Ammeter of 1mA full scale current using appropriate resistors. These are then used to measure the voltage and current in the Ohmâ€™s law experiment with R = 1000 $\Omega$ resistor by using an ideal cell. Which of the following statement(s) is/are correct?
        \begin{tasks}(2)
            \task The resistance of the Voltmeter will be 100 k$\Omega$
            \task The resistance of the Ammeter will be 0.02 $\Omega$ (round off to 2\textsuperscript{nd} decimal place)
            \task The measured value of R will be 978 $\Omega$ $<$ R $<$ 982 $\Omega$
            \task If the ideal cell is replaced by a cell having internal resistance of 5 $\Omega$ then the measured value of R will be more than 1000 $\Omega$
        \end{tasks}
\end{enumerate}

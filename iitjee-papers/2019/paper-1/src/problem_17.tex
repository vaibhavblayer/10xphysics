\begin{enumerate}
    \item A liquid at \(30^\circ C\) is poured very slowly into a Calorimeter that is at temperature of \(110^\circ C\). The boiling temperature of the liquid is \(80^\circ C\). It is found that the first \(5 \text{ gm}\) of the liquid completely evaporates. After pouring another \(80 \text{ gm}\) of the liquid the equilibrium temperature is found to be \(50^\circ C\). The ratio of the Latent heat of the liquid to its specific heat will be \_\_\_\_ \(^\circ C\).

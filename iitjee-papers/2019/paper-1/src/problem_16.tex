\begin{enumerate}
    \item A parallel plate capacitor of capacitance $C$ has spacing $d$ between two plates having area $A$. The region between the plates is filled with $N$ dielectric layers, parallel to its plates, each with thickness $\delta = \frac{d}{N}$. The dielectric constant of the $m^{th}$ layer is $K_m = K\left( 1 + \frac{m}{N} \right)$. For a very large $N$ ($> 10^3$), the capacitance $C$ is $\propto \left(\frac{K\varepsilon_0A}{d \ln 2}\right)$. The value of $\alpha$ will be \underline{\hspace{2cm}}.
    \item[$\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space]

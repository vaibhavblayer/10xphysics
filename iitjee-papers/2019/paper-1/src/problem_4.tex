\begin{enumerate}
    \item In a radioactive sample, \( _{19}^{40}K \) nuclei either decay into stable \( _{20}^{40}Ca \) nuclei with decay constant \( 4.5 \times 10^{-10} \) per year or into stable \( _{18}^{40}Ar \) nuclei with decay constant \( 0.5 \times 10^{-10} \) per year. Given that in this sample all the stable \( _{20}^{40}Ca \) and \( _{18}^{40}Ar \) nuclei are produced by the \( _{19}^{40}K \) nuclei only. In time \( t \times 10^{9} \) years, if the ratio of the sum of stable \( _{20}^{40}Ca \) and \( _{18}^{40}Ar \) nuclei to the radioactive \( _{19}^{40}K \) nuclei is 99, the value of \( t \) will be,\\

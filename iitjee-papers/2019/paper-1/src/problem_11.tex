\begin{enumerate}
    \item Let us consider a system of units in which mass and angular momentum are dimensionless. If length has dimension of \( L \), which of the following statement(s) is/are correct?
        \begin{tasks}(2)
            \task The dimension of linear momentum is \( L^{-1} \)
            \task The dimension of energy is \( L^{-2} \)
            \task The dimension of force is \( L^{-3} \)
            \task The dimension of power is \( L^{-5} \)
        \end{tasks}
\end{enumerate}

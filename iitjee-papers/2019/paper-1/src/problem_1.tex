\begin{enumerate}
    \item Consider a spherical gaseous cloud of mass density \( \rho(r) \) in free space where \( r \) is the radial distance from its center. The gaseous cloud is made of particles of equal mass \( m \) moving in circular orbits about the common center with the same kinetic energy \( K \). The force acting on the particles is their mutual gravitational force. If \( \rho(r) \) is constant in time, the particle number density \( n(r) = \frac{\rho(r)}{m} \) is \[ [G \text{ is universal gravitational constant}] \]

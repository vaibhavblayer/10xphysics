\begin{enumerate}
    \item A charged shell of radius \( R \) carries a total charge \( Q \). Given \( \Phi \) as the flux of electric field through a closed cylindrical surface of height \( h \), radius \( r \) and with its center same as that of the shell. Here, center of the cylinder is a point on the axis of the cylinder which is equidistant from its top and bottom surfaces. Which of the following option(s) is/are correct? 
    \begin{tasks}(2)
        \task If \( h > 2R \) and \( r > R \) then \( \Phi = Q/\epsilon_0 \)
        \task If \( h < 8R/5 \) and \( r = 3R/5 \) then \( \Phi = 0 \)
        \task If \( h > 2R \) and \( r = 3R/5 \) then \( \Phi = Q/5\epsilon_0 \)
        \task If \( h > 2R \) and \( r = 4R/5 \) then \( \Phi = Q/5\epsilon_0 \)
    \end{tasks}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A thin and uniform rod of mass \( M \) and length \( L \) is held vertical on a floor with large friction. The rod is released from rest so that it falls by rotating about its contact-point with the floor without slipping. Which of the following statement(s) is/are correct, when the rod makes an angle \( 60^\circ \) with vertical? [\( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity]
        \begin{tasks}(2)
            \task The angular speed of the rod will be \( \sqrt{\frac{3g}{2L}} \)
            \task The angular acceleration of the rod will be \( \frac{2g}{L} \)
            \task The radial acceleration of the rod's center of mass will be \( \frac{3g}{4} \)
            \task The normal reaction force from the floor on the rod will be \( \frac{Mg}{16} \)
        \end{tasks}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Suppose a \(_{88}^{226}\text{Ra}\) nucleus at rest and in ground state undergoes \(\alpha\)-decay to a \(_{86}^{222}\text{Rn}\) nucleus in its excited state. The kinetic energy of the emitted \(\alpha\) particle is found to be 4.44 MeV. \(_{86}^{222}\text{Rn}\) nucleus then goes to its ground state by \(\gamma\)-decay. The energy of the emitted \(\gamma\) photon is \_\_\_ keV. \\
    [Given: atomic mass of \(_{88}^{226}\text{Ra}\) = 226.005 u, atomic mass of \(_{86}^{222}\text{Rn}\) = 222.000 u, atomic mass of \(\alpha\) particle = 4.000 u, 1 u = 931 MeV/c\(^2\), c is speed of the light]

\begin{enumerate}
    \item An electric dipole with dipole moment $\frac{p_0}{\sqrt{2}}(\hat{i} + \hat{j})$ is held fixed at the origin O in the presence of a uniform electric field of magnitude $E_0$. If the potential is constant on a circle of radius $R$ centered at the origin as shown in figure, then the correct statement(s) is/are:
        \begin{tasks}(2)
            	\task $R = \left( \frac{p_0}{4\pi\epsilon_0E_0} \right)^{1/3}$
            	\task Total electric field at point A is $\vec{E}_A = \sqrt{2E_0}(\hat{i} + \hat{j})$
            	\task Total electric field at point B is $\vec{E}_B = 0$
            	\task The magnitude of total electric field on any two points of the circle will be same.

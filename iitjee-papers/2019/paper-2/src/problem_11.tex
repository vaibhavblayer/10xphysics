\begin{enumerate}
    \item A monochromatic light is incident from air on a refracting surface of a prism of angle \(75^\circ\) and refractive index \(n_0 = \sqrt{3}\). The other refracting surface of the prism is coated by a thin film of material of refractive index \(n\) as shown in figure. The light suffers total internal reflection at the coated prism surface for an incidence angle of \(\theta \leq 60^\circ\). The value of \(n^2\) is \_\_\_\_\_.

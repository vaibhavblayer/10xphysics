\begin{enumerate}
    \item A mixture of ideal gas containing 5 moles of monatomic gas and 1 mole of rigid diatomic gas is initially at pressure \( P_0 \), volume \( V_0 \), and temperature \( T_0 \). If the gas mixture is adiabatically compressed to a volume \( V_0/4 \), then the correct statement(s) is/are, (Given \( 2^{1.2} = 2.3 \), \( 2^{3.2} = 9.2 \); R is gas constant)
        \begin{tasks}(2)
            \task The work \( |W| \) done during the process is \( 13RT_0 \)
            \task The average kinetic energy of the gas mixture after compression is in between \( 18RT_0 \) and \( 19RT_0 \)
            \task The final pressure of the gas mixture after compression is in between \( 9P_0 \) and \( 10P_0 \)
            \task Adiabatic constant of the gas mixture is 1.6
        \end{tasks}

\item A block is moving on an inclined plane making an angle \(45^\circ\) with the horizontal and the coefficient of friction is \(\mu\). The force required to just push it up the inclined plane is 3 times the force required to just prevent it from sliding down. If we define \(N = 10 \mu\), then \(N\) is \underline{\hspace{2.5cm}}.

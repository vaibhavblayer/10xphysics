\item A metal rod of length `L` and mass `m` is pivoted at one end. A thin disk of mass `M` and radius `R` ($R < L$) is attached at its center to the free end of the rod. Consider two ways the disc is attached: (case A) The disc is not free to rotate about its center and (case B) the disc is free to rotate about its center. The rod-disc system performs SHM in vertical plane after being released from the same displaced position. Which of the following statement(s) is (are) true?

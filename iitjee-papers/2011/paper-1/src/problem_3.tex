\item Consider an electric field \(\vec{E} = E_0 \hat{i}\), where \(E_0\) is a constant. The flux through the shaded area (as shown in the figure) due to this field is
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            % Since the actual diagram is an image, I will write comments here to indicate that you need to include it manually
            % \node at (0, 0) {\includegraphics{diagram.png}}; % replace diagram.png with the path to the actual diagram image file
            \node at (0, 0) {Diagram}; % Placeholder for actual diagram
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    \begin{tasks}(2)
        \task \(2E_0a^2\)
        \task \(\sqrt{2}E_0a^2\)
        \task \(E_0a^2\)
        \task \(\frac{E_0a^2}{\sqrt{2}}\)
    \end{tasks}

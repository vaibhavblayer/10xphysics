\item Steel wire of length `L` at \(40^\circ C\) is suspended from the ceiling and then a mass `m` is hung from its free end. The wire is cooled down from \(40^\circ C\) to \(30^\circ C\) to regain its original length `L`. The coefficient of linear thermal expansion of the steel is \(10^{-5} / ^\circ C\), Young's modulus of steel is \(10^{11} \, \text{N/m}^2\) and radius of the wire is 1 mm. Assume that \( L \gg \) diameter of the wire. Then the value of `m` in kg is nearly \underline{\hspace{2.5cm}}.

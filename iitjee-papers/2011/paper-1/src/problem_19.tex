\item Four point charges, each of $+q$, are rigidly fixed at the four corners of a square planar soap film of side `$a$'. The surface tension of the soap film is $\gamma$. The system of charges and planar film are in equilibrium, and $a = k \left[ \frac{q^2}{\gamma} \right]^{\frac{1}{2}}$, where `$k$' is a constant. Then $N$ is \underline{\hspace{2.5cm}}.

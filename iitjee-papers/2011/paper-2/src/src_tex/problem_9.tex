\item Two solid spheres A and B of equal volumes but of different densities \(d_A\) and \(d_B\) are connected by a string. They are fully immersed in a fluid of density \(d_F\). They get arranged into an equilibrium state as shown in the figure with a tension in the string. The arrangement is possible only if

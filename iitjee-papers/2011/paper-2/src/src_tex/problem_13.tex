\item A train is moving along a straight line with a constant acceleration \(a\). A boy standing in the train throws a ball forward with a speed of \(10\ \text{m/s}\), at an angle of \(60^\circ\) to the horizontal. The boy has to move forward by \(1.15\ \text{m}\) inside the train to catch the ball back at the initial height. The acceleration of the train, in \(\text{m/s}^2\), is \underline{\hspace{2.5cm}}.

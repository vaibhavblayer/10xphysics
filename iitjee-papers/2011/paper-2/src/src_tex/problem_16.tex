\item Water (with refractive index $=\frac{4}{3}$) in a tank is $18\ \text{cm}$ deep. Oil of refractive index $=\frac{7}{4}$ lies on water making a convex surface of radius of curvature $R = 6\ \text{cm}$ as shown. Consider oil to act as a thin lens. An object `S' is placed $24\ \text{cm}$ above water surface. The location of its image is at `x' cm above the bottom of the tank. Then `x' is

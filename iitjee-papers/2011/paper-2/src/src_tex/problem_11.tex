\item Which of the following statement(s) is/are correct?
    \begin{tasks}(2)
        \task If the electric field due to a point charge varies as \( r^{-2.5} \) instead of \( r^{-2} \), the Gauss law will still be valid.
        \task The Gauss law can be used to calculate the field distribution around an electric dipole.
        \task If the electric field between two point charges is zero somewhere, then the sign of the two charges is the same.
        \task The work done by the external force in moving a unit positive charge from point A at potential \( V_A \) to point B at potential \( V_B \) is \( (V_B - V_A) \).
    \end{tasks}

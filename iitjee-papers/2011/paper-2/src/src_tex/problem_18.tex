\item A silver sphere of radius 1 cm and work function 4.7 eV is suspended from an insulating thread in free-space. It is under continuous illumination of 200 nm wavelength light. As photoelectrons are emitted, the sphere gets charged and acquires a potential. The maximum number of photoelectrons emitted from the sphere is \( A \times 10^z \) (where \( 1 < A < 10 \)). The value of 'z' is \underline{\hspace{2.5cm}}.

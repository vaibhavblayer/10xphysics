\item A series R-C circuit is connected to AC voltage source. Consider two cases; (A) when C is without a dielectric medium and (B) when C is filled with dielectric of constant 4. The current $I_R$ through the resistor and voltage $V_C$ across the capacitor are compared in the two cases. Which of the following is/are true?
    \begin{tasks}(2)
        \task $I^A_R > I^B_R$
        \task $I^A_R < I^B_R$
        \task $V^A_C > V^B_C$
        \task $V^A_C < V^B_C$
    \end{tasks}

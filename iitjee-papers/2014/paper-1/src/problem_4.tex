\item A parallel plate capacitor has a dielectric slab of dielectric constant \(K\) between its plates that covers \(1/3\) of the area of its plates, as shown in the figure. The total capacitance of the capacitor is \(C\) while that of the portion with dielectric in between is \(C_1\). When the capacitor is charged, the plate area covered by the dielectric gets charge \(Q_1\) and the rest of the area gets charge \(Q_2\). The electric field in the dielectric is \(E_1\) and that in the other portion is \(E_2\). Choose the correct option/options, ignoring edge effects.

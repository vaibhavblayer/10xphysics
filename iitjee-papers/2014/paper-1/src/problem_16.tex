    \item A galvanometer gives full scale deflection with \(0.006\, A\) current. By connecting it to a \(4990\, \Omega\) resistance, it can be converted into a voltmeter of range \(0 - 30\, V\). If connected to a \(\frac{2n}{249}\, \Omega\) resistance, it becomes an ammeter of range \(0 - 1.5\, A\). The value of \(n\) is \underline{\hspace{2.5 cm}}.

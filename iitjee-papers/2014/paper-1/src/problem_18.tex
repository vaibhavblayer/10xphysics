    \item A rocket is moving in a gravity free space with a constant acceleration of \(2 \, \text{ms}^{-2}\) along \(+x\) direction (see figure). The length of a chamber inside the rocket is \(4 \, \text{m}\). A ball is thrown from the left end of the chamber in \(+x\) direction with a speed of \(0.3 \, \text{ms}^{-1}\) relative to the rocket. At the same time, another ball is thrown in \(-x\) direction with a speed of \(0.2 \, \text{ms}^{-1}\) from its right end relative to the rocket. The time in seconds when the two balls hit each other is \underline{\hspace{2.5 cm}}.

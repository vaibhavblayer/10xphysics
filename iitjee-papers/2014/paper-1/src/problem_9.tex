\item A transparent thin film of uniform thickness and refractive index \( n_1 = 1.4 \) is coated on the convex spherical surface of radius \( R \) at one end of a long solid glass cylinder of refractive index \( n_2 = 1.5 \), as shown in the figure. Rays of light parallel to the axis of the cylinder traversing through the film from air to glass get focused at distance \( f_1 \) from the film, while rays of light traversing from glass to air get focused at distance \( f_2 \) from the film. Then

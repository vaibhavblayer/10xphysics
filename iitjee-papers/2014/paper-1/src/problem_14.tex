    \item Two parallel wires in the plane of the paper are distance \(X_0\) apart. A point charge is moving with speed \(u\) between the wires in the same plane at a distance \(X_1\) from one of the wires. When the wires carry current of magnitude \(I\) in the same direction, the radius of curvature of the path of the point charge is \(R_1\). In contrast, if the currents \(I\) in the two wires have directions opposite to each other, the radius of curvature of the path is \(R_2\). If \(\frac{X_0}{X_1} = 3\), the value of \(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\) is \underline{\hspace{2.5 cm}}.

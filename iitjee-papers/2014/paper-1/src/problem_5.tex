\item Let \( E_1(r) \), \( E_2(r) \) and \( E_3(r) \) be the respective electric fields at a distance \( r \) from a point charge \( Q \), an infinitely long wire with constant linear charge density \( \lambda \), and an infinite plane with uniform surface charge density \( \sigma \). If \( E_1 (r_0) = E_2 (r_0) = E_3 (r_0) \) at a given distance \( r_0 \), then
    \begin{tasks}(2)
        \task \( Q = 4\pi r_0^2 \sigma \)
        \task \( r_0 = \frac{\lambda}{2\pi\sigma} \)
        \task \( E_1 (r_0/2) = 2E_2 (r_0/2) \)
        \task \( E_2 (r_0/2) = 4E_3 (r_0/2) \)
    \end{tasks}

    \item To find the distance $d$ over which a signal can be seen clearly in foggy conditions, a railways engineer uses dimensional analysis and assumes that the distance depends on the mass density $\rho$ of the fog, intensity (power/area) $S$ of the light from the signal and its frequency $f$. The engineer finds that $d \propto S^{1/n}$. The value of $n$ is \underline{\hspace{2.5 cm}}.

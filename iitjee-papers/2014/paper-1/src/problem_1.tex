\item At time \( t = 0 \), terminal A in the circuit shown in the figure is connected to B by a key and an alternating current \( I(t) = I_0\cos(\omega t) \), with \( I_0 = 1 A \) and \( \omega = 500 \text{ rad s}^{-1} \) starts flowing in it with the initial direction shown in the figure. At \( t = \frac{7\pi}{6\omega} \), the key is switched from B to D. Now onwards only A and D are connected. A total charge \( Q \) flows from the battery to charge the capacitor fully. If \( C=20\mu F \), \( R=10 \Omega \) and the battery is ideal with \( emf \) of \( 50 V \), identify the correct statement(s).

    \begin{tasks}(2)
        \task Magnitude of the maximum charge on the capacitor before \( t = \frac{7\pi}{6\omega} \) is \( 1 \times 10^{-3} C \).
        \task The current in the left part of the circuit just before \( t = \frac{7\pi}{6\omega} \) is clockwise.
        \task Immediately after A is connected to D, the current in \( R \) is \( 10 A \).
        \task \( Q = 2 \times 10^{-3} C \).

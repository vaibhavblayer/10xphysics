\item A glass capillary tube is of the shape of a truncated cone with an apex angle \emph{also} that its two ends have cross sections of different radii. When dipped in water vertically, water rises in it to a height \( h \), where the radius of its cross section is \( b \). If the surface tension of water is \( S \), its density is \( \rho \), and its contact angle with glass is \( \theta \), the value of \( h \) will be (\( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity)

\item A planet of radius \( R = \frac{1}{10} \times \) (radius of Earth) has the same mass density as Earth. Scientists dig a well of depth \( \frac{R}{5} \) on it and lower a wire of the same length and of linear mass density \( 10^{-3} \, \text{kgm}^{-1} \) into it. If the wire is not touching anywhere, the force applied at the top of the wire by a person holding it in place is (take the radius of Earth \( = 6 \times 10^6 \, \text{m} \) and the acceleration due to gravity on Earth is \( 10 \, \text{ms}^{-2} \))

\item A person in a lift is holding a water jar, which has a small hole at the lower end of its side. When the lift is at rest, the water jet coming out of the hole hits the floor of the lift at a distance of 1.2 m from the person. In the following, state of the lift's motion is given in List I and the distance where the water jet hits the floor of the lift is given in List II. Match the statements from List I with those in List II and select the correct answer using the code given below the list.

        (P)& Lift is accelerating vertically up. & (1) & \(d = 1.2\) m\\
        (Q)& Lift is accelerating vertically down with an acceleration less than the gravitational acceleration. & (2) & \(d > 1.2\) m\\
        (R)& Lift is moving vertically up with constant speed. & (3) & \(d < 1.2\) m\\
        (S)& Lift is falling freely. & (4) &No water leaks out of the jar\\

\item A point source $S$ is placed at the bottom of a transparent block of height $10\ mm$ and refractive index $2.72$. It is immersed in a lower refractive index liquid as shown in the figure. It is found that the light emerging from the block to the liquid forms a circular bright spot of diameter $11.54\ mm$ on the top of the block. The refractive index of the liquid is

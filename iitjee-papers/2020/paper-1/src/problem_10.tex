\begin{enumerate}
    \item A uniform electric field, $\vec{E} = -400\sqrt{3}$ N C$^{-1}$ is applied in a region. A charged particle of mass $m$ carrying positive charge $q$ is projected in this region with an initial speed of $2\sqrt{10} \times 10^6$ ms$^{-1}$. This particle is aimed to hit a target $T$, which is 5 m away from its entry point into the field as shown schematically in the figure. Take $\frac{q}{m} = 10^{10}$ Ckg$^{-1}$. Then
    \begin{tasks}(2)
        \task the particle will hit $T$ if projected at an angle $45^\circ$ from the horizontal
        \task the particle will hit $T$ if projected either at an angle $30^\circ$ or $60^\circ$ from the horizontal
        \task time taken by the particle to hit $T$ could be $\frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{6}}$ $\mu$s as well as $\frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{2}}$ $\mu$s
        \task time taken by the particle to hit $T$ is $\frac{5}{\sqrt{3}}$ $\mu$s

 9. Sometimes it is convenient to construct a system of units so that all quantities can be expressed in terms of only one physical quantity. In one such system, dimensions of different quantities are given in terms of a quantity X as follows: [position] = [X^a]; [speed] = [X^b]; [acceleration] = [X^c]; [linear momentum] = [X^d]; [force] = [X^e]. Then

$$\text{A)}\space p+q=2\beta$$

$$\text{B)}\space p+q-r=\beta$$

$$\text{C)}\space p+q-r=\alpha$$

$$\text{D)}\space p+q+r=\beta$$

\item A football of radius \(R\) is kept on a hole of radius \(r\) (\(r < R\)) made on a plank kept horizontally. One end of the plank is now lifted so that it gets tilted making an angle \(\theta\) from the horizontal as shown in the figure below. The maximum value of \(\theta\) so that the football does not start rolling down the plank satisfies (figure is schematic and not drawn to scale)
\begin{tasks}(2)
\item \(\sin \theta = \frac{r}{R}\)
\item \(\tan \theta = \frac{r}{R}\)
\item \(\sin \theta = \frac{r}{2R}\)
\item \(\cos \theta = \frac{r}{2R}\)
\end{tasks}

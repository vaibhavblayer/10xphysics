 1. A point particle of mass \(m\) carrying a positive charge \(q\) is attached to its other end. The entire system is kept on a smooth horizontal surface. When a point dipole \(p\) pointing towards the charge \(q\) is fixed at the origin, the spring gets stretched to a length \(l\) and attains a new equilibrium position (see figure below). If the point mass is now displaced slightly by \( \Delta l<l\) from its equilibrium position and released, it is found to oscillate at frequency \( \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \). The value of \(\delta \) is _____.

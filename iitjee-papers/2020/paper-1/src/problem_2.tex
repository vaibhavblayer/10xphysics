 1. A light disc made of aluminium (a nonmagnetic material) is kept horizontally and is free to rotate about its axis as shown in the figure. A strong magnet is held vertically at a point above the disc away from its axis. On revolving the magnet about the axis of the disc, the disc will (figure is schematic and not drawn to scale)

\task Rotate in the same direction as the direction of magnet's motion
\task Not rotate and its temperature will remain unchanged
\task Not rotate but its temperature will slowly rise

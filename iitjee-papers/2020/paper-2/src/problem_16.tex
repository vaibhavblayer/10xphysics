\begin{enumerate}
    \item A cubical solid aluminium (bulk modulus $= -V \frac{dP}{dV} = 70$ GPa) block has an edge length of 1 m on the surface of the earth. It is kept on the floor of a 5 km deep ocean. Taking the average density of water and the acceleration due to gravity to be $10^3 \, \text{kg m}^{-3}$ and $10 \, \text{ms}^{-2}$, respectively, the change in the edge length of the block in mm is \underline{\hspace{3cm}}.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item In an X-ray tube, electrons emitted from a filament (cathode) carrying current I hit a target (anode) at a distance \(d\) from the cathode. The target is kept at a potential \(V\) higher than the cathode resulting in emission of continuous and characteristic X-rays. If the filament current \(I\) is decreased to \(\frac{I}{2}\), the potential difference \(V\) is increased to \(2V\), and the separation distance \(d\) is reduced to \(\frac{d}{2}\), then
        \begin{tasks}(2)
            \task the cut-off wavelength will reduce to half, and the wavelengths of the characteristic X-rays will remain the same
            \task the cut-off wavelength as well as the wavelengths of the characteristic X-rays will remain the same
            \task the cut-off wavelength will reduce to half, and the intensities of all the X-rays will decrease
            \task the cut-off wavelength will become two times larger, and the intensity of all the X-rays will decrease
        \end{tasks}
\end{enumerate}

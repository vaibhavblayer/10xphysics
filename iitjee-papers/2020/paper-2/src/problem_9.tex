\begin{enumerate}
    \item A rod of mass $m$ and length $L$, pivoted at one of its ends, is hanging vertically. A bullet of the same mass moving at speed $v$ strikes the rod horizontally at a distance $x$ from its pivoted end and gets embedded in it. The combined system now rotates with angular speed $\omega$ about the pivot. The maximum angular speed $\omega_M$ is achieved for $x = x_M$. Then
        \begin{tasks}(2)
            \task $\omega = \frac{3vx}{L^2+3x^2}$
            \task $\omega = \frac{12vx}{L^2+12x^2}$
            \task $x_M = \frac{L}{\sqrt{3}}$
            \task $\omega_M = \frac{v}{2L}\sqrt{3}$
        \end{tasks}

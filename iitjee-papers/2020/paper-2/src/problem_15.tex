\begin{enumerate}
    \item Two capacitors with capacitance values \(C_1 = 2000 \pm 10 \text{ pF}\) and \(C_2 = 3000 \pm 15 \text{ pF}\) are connected in series. The voltage applied across this combination is \(V = 5.00 \pm 0.02 \text{ V}\). The percentage error in the calculation of the energy stored in this combination of capacitors is \_\_\_\_\_.
\end{enumerate}

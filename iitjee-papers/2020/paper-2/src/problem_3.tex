    \item[Q.3] Two large circular discs separated by a distance of \(0.01 \, \text{m}\) are connected to a battery via a switch as shown in the figure. Charged oil drops of density \(900 \, \text{kg m}^{-3}\) are released through a tiny hole at the center of the top disc. Once some oil drops achieve terminal velocity, the switch is closed to apply a voltage of \(200 \, \text{V}\) across the discs. As a result, an oil drop of radius \(8 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\) stops moving vertically and floats between the discs. The number of electrons present in this oil drop is \_\_\_\_\_. (neglect the buoyancy force, take acceleration due to gravity \(= 10 \, \text{ms}^{-2}\) and charge on an electron \((e) = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C}\))

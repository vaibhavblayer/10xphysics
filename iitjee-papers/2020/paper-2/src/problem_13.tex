\begin{enumerate}
    \item A spherical bubble inside water has radius \( R \). Take the pressure inside the bubble and the water pressure to be \( p_0 \). The bubble now gets compressed radially in an adiabatic manner so that its radius becomes \( R - a \). For \( a \ll R \) the magnitude of the work done in the process is given by \( (4\pi p_0 R^2 a^2)X \), where \( X \) is a constant and \( \gamma = \frac{C_p}{C_v} = \frac{41}{30} \). The value of \( X \) is \underline{\hspace{3cm}}.

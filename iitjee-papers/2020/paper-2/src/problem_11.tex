\begin{enumerate}
    \item Two identical non-conducting solid spheres of same mass and charge are suspended in air from a common point by two non-conducting, massless strings of same length. At equilibrium, the angle between the strings is \(\alpha\). The spheres are now immersed in a dielectric liquid of density 800 kg m\(^{-3}\) and dielectric constant 21. If the angle between the strings remains the same after the immersion, then
        \begin{tasks}(2)
            \task electric force between the spheres remains unchanged
            \task electric force between the spheres reduces
            \task mass density of the spheres is 840 kg m\(^{-3}\)
            \task the tension in the strings holding the spheres remains unchanged
        \end{tasks}
\end{enumerate}

    \item One mole of a monatomic ideal gas undergoes an adiabatic expansion in which its volume becomes eight times its initial value. If the initial temperature of the gas is \(100 \, \text{K}\) and the universal gas constant \(R = 8.0 \, \text{J} \, \text{mol}^{-1}\text{K}^{-1}\), the decrease in its internal energy, in \(\text{Joule}\), is \underline{\hspace{3cm}}.

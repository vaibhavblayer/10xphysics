    \item In a radioactive decay chain, \({}^{232}_{90}\text{Th}\) nucleus decays to \({}^{212}_{82}\text{Pb}\) nucleus. Let \(N_\alpha\) and \(N_\beta\) be the number of \(\alpha\) and \(\beta^-\) particles, respectively, emitted in this decay process. Which of the following statements is (are) true?
        \begin{tasks}(2)
            \task \(N_\alpha = 5\)
            \task \(N_\alpha = 6\)
            \task \(N_\beta = 2\)
            \task \(N_\beta = 4\)
        \end{tasks}

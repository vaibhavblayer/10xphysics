\item Consider a thin square plate floating on a viscous liquid in a large tank. The height \( h \) of the liquid in the tank is much less than the width of the tank. The floating plate is pulled horizontally with a constant velocity \( u_0 \). Which of the following statements is (are) true?
    \begin{tasks}(1)
        \task The resistive force of liquid on the plate is inversely proportional to \( h \)
        \task The resistive force of liquid on the plate is independent of the area of the plate
        \task The tangential (shear) stress on the floor of the tank increases with \( u_0 \)
        \task The tangential (shear) stress on the plate varies linearly with the viscosity \( \eta \) of the liquid
    \end{tasks}

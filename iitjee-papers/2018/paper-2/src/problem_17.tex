\item One mole of a monatomic ideal gas undergoes four thermodynamic processes as shown schematically in the PV-diagram below. Among these four processes, one is isobaric, one is isochoric, one is isothermal and one is adiabatic. Match the processes mentioned in List-1 with the corresponding statements in List-II.

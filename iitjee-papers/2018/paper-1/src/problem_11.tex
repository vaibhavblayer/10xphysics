\item Three identical capacitors \( C_1, C_2 \) and \( C_3 \) have a capacitance of \( 1.0 \mu F \) each and they are uncharged initially. They are connected in a circuit as shown in the figure and \( C_1 \) is then filled completely with a dielectric material of relative permittivity \( \varepsilon_r \). The cell electromotive force (emf) \( V_0 = 8 V \). First the switch \( S_1 \) is closed while the switch \( S_2 \) is kept open. When the capacitor \( C_3 \) is fully charged, \( S_1 \) is opened and \( S_2 \) is closed simultaneously. When all the capacitors reach equilibrium, the charge on \( C_3 \) is found to be \( 5 \mu C \). The value of \( \varepsilon_r = \underline{\hspace{3cm}} \).

\item In the xy-plane, the region \(y > 0\) has a uniform magnetic field \(B_1\mathbf{k}\) and the region \(y < 0\) has another uniform magnetic field \(B_2\mathbf{k}\). A positively charged particle is projected from the origin along the positive y-axis with speed \(v_0 = \pi \, \text{m s}^{-1}\) at \(t = 0\), as shown in the figure. Neglect gravity in this problem. Let \(t = T\) be the time when the particle crosses the x-axis from below for the first time. If \(B_2 = 4B_1\), the average speed of the particle, in \(\text{m s}^{-1}\), along the x-axis in the time interval \(T\) is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

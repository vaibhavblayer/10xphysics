    \item A person measures the depth of a well by measuring the time interval between dropping a stone and receiving the sound of impact with the bottom of the well. The error in his measurement of time is \(\delta T = 0.01\) seconds and he measures the depth of the well to be \(L = 20\) meters. Take the acceleration due to gravity \(g = 10 \, \text{ms}^{-2}\) and the velocity of sound is \(300 \, \text{ms}^{-1}\). Then the fractional error in the measurement, \(\delta L / L\), is closest to

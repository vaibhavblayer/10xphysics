    \item A rigid uniform bar AB of length \(L\) is slipping from its vertical position on a frictionless floor (as shown in the figure). At some instant of time, the angle made by the bar with the vertical is \(\theta\). Which of the following statements about its motion is/are correct?
        \begin{tasks}(1)
            \task The midpoint of the bar will fall vertically downward
            \task The trajectory of the point A is a parabola
            \task Instantaneous torque about the point in contact with the floor is proportional to \(\sin \theta\)
            \task When the bar makes an angle \(\theta\) with the vertical, the displacement of its midpoint from the initial position is proportional to \((1 - \cos \theta)\)
        \end{tasks}

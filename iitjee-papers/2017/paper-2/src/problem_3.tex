    \item A photoelectric material having work-function \(\phi_0\) is illuminated with light of wavelength \(\lambda\) (\(\lambda < \frac{hc}{\phi_0}\)). The fastest photoelectron has a de Broglie wavelength \(\lambda_d\). A change in wavelength of the incident light by \(\Delta \lambda\) results in a change \(\Delta \lambda_d\) in \(\lambda_d\). Then the ratio \(\frac{\Delta \lambda_d}{\Delta \lambda}\) is proportional to
        \begin{tasks}(2)
            \task \(\lambda_d / \lambda\)
            \task \(\lambda_d^2 / \lambda^2\)
            \task \(\lambda_d / \lambda^3\)
            \task \(\lambda_d^3 / \lambda^2\)
        \end{tasks}

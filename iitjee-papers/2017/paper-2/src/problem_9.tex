Certainly! Here is the LaTeX formatted version of the multiple-choice question present in the image:


    \item The instantaneous voltages at three terminals marked X, Y and Z are given by
    \[
    V_X = V_0 \sin \omega t, \quad V_Y = V_0 \sin \left( \omega t + \frac{2\pi}{3} \right), \quad \text{and} \quad V_Z = V_0 \sin \left( \omega t + \frac{4\pi}{3} \right).
    \]
    An ideal voltmeter is configured to read \(rms\) value of the potential difference between its terminals. It is connected between points X and Y and then between Y and Z. The reading(s) of the voltmeter will be
        \begin{tasks}(2)
            \task \( V_{\text{rms}}^{XY} = V_0 \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \)
            \task \( V_{\text{rms}}^{YZ} = V_0 \frac{1}{2} \)
            \task \( V_{\text{rms}}^{XY} = V_0 \)
            \task independent of the choice of the two terminals
        \end{tasks}

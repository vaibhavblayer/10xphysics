    \item Consider an expanding sphere of instantaneous radius \( R \) whose total mass remains constant. The expansion is such that the instantaneous density \( \rho \) remains uniform throughout the volume. The rate of fractional change in density \( \left(\frac{1}{\rho} \frac{d\rho}{dt}\right) \) is constant. The velocity \( v \) of any point on the surface of the expanding sphere is proportional to

    \item A rocket is launched normal to the surface of the Earth, away from the Sun, along the line joining the Sun and the Earth. The Sun is \(3\times10^5\) times heavier than the Earth and is at a distance \(2.5\times10^4\) times larger than the radius of the Earth. The escape velocity from Earth's gravitational field is \(v_e = 11.2 \text{ km s}^{-1}\). The minimum initial velocity (\(v_s\)) required for the rocket to be able to leave the Sun-Earth system is closest to (Ignore the rotation and revolution of the Earth and the presence of any other planet)

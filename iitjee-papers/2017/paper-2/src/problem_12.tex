    \item A source of constant voltage \( V \) is connected to a resistance \( R \) and two ideal inductors \( L_1 \) and \( L_2 \) through a switch \( S \) as shown. There is no mutual inductance between the two inductors. The switch \( S \) is initially open. At \( t = 0 \), the switch is closed and current begins to flow. Which of the following options is/are correct?
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzpicture}
                \node {Diagram};
            \end{tikzpicture}
        \end{center}
        \begin{tasks}(1)
            \task After a long time, the current through \( L_1 \) will be \( \frac{V}{R} \frac{L_2}{L_1+L_2} \)
            \task After a long time, the current through \( L_2 \) will be \( \frac{V}{R} \frac{L_1}{L_1+L_2} \)
            \task The ratio of the currents through \( L_1 \) and \( L_2 \) is fixed at all times (\( t > 0 \))
            \task At \( t = 0 \), the current through the resistance \( R \) is \( \frac{V}{R} \)
        \end{tasks}

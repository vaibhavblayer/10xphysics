    \item A flat plate is moving normal to its plane through a gas under the action of a constant force \( F \). The gas is kept at a very low pressure. The speed of the plate \( v \) is much less than the average speed \( u \) of the gas molecules. Which of the following options is/are true?
        \begin{tasks}(1)
            \task The pressure difference between the leading and trailing faces of the plate is proportional to \( uv \)
            \task The resistive force experienced by the plate is proportional to \( v \)
            \task The plate will continue to move with constant non-zero acceleration, at all times
            \task At a later time the external force \( F \) balances the resistive force
        \end{tasks}

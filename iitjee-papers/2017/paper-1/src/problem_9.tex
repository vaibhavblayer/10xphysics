    \item An electron in a hydrogen atom undergoes a transition from an orbit with quantum number \( n_i \) to another with quantum number \( n_f \). \( V_i \) and \( V_f \) are respectively the initial and final potential energies of the electron. If \( \frac{V_i}{V_f} = 6.25 \), then the smallest possible \( n_f \) is \underline{\hspace{2.5 cm}}.

    \item A drop of liquid of radius \( R = 10^{-2} \) m having surface tension \( S = \frac{0.1}{4\pi} \) Nm\(^{-1}\) divides itself into \( K \) identical drops. In this process the total change in the surface energy \( \Delta U = 10^{-3} \) J. If \( K = 10^\alpha \) then the value of \( \alpha \) is

    \item In the circuit shown, \( L = 1 \mu H \), \( C = 1 \mu F \) and \( R = 1 k\Omega \). They are connected in series with an a.c. source \( V = V_0 \sin \omega t \) as shown. Which of the following options is/are correct?

        \begin{tikzpicture}

        \begin{tasks}(1)
            \task The current will be in phase with the voltage if \( \omega = 10^4 \) rad.s\(^{-1}\)
            \task The frequency at which the current will be in phase with the voltage is independent of \( R \)
            \task At \( \omega \approx 0 \) the current flowing through the circuit becomes nearly zero
            \task At \( \omega \gg 10^6 \) rad.s\(^{-1}\), the circuit behaves like a capacitor

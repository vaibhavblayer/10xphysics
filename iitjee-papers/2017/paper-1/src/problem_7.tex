    \item For an isosceles prism of angle \( A \) and refractive index \( \mu \), it is found that the angle of minimum deviation \( \delta_m = A \). Which of the following options is/are correct?
        \begin{tasks}(1)
            \task For the angle of incidence \( i_1 = A \), the ray inside the prism is parallel to the base of the prism
            \task For this prism, the refractive index \( \mu \) and the angle of prism \( A \) are related as \( A = \frac{1}{2} \cos^{-1} \left( \frac{\mu}{2} \right) \)
            \task At minimum deviation, the incident angle \( i_1 \) and the refracting angle \( r_1 \) at the first refracting surface are related by \( r_1 = \frac{i_1}{2} \)
            \task For this prism, the emergent ray at the second surface will be tangential to the surface when the angle of incidence at the first surface is \( i_1 = \sin^{-1} \left( \sqrt{\sin A \left( 4 \cos^2 \frac{A}{2} - 1 - \cos A \right)} \right) \)
        \end{tasks}

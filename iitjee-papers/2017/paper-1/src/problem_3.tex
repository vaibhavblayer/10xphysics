\item A block \(M\) hangs vertically at the bottom end of a uniform rope of constant mass per
unit length. The top end of the rope is attached to a fixed rigid support at \(O\). A transverse wave
pulse (Pulse 1) of wavelength \(\lambda_0\) is produced at point \(O\) on the rope. The pulse takes time
\(T_{O \to A}\) to reach point \(A\). If the wave pulse of wavelength \(\lambda_0\) is produced at point
\(A\) (Pulse 2) without disturbing the position of \(M\) it takes time \(T_{A \to O}\) to reach point
\(O\). Which of the following options is/are correct?

\begin{tasks}(1)
\task The time \(T_{A \to O} = T_{O \to A}\)
\task The velocities of the two pulses (Pulse 1 and Pulse 2) are the same at the midpoint of the rope
\task The wavelength of Pulse 1 becomes longer when it reaches point \(A\)
\task The velocity of any pulse along the rope is independent of its frequency and wavelength

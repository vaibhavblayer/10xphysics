\item A closed container contains a homogeneous mixture of two moles of an ideal monatomic gas $(\gamma = 5/3)$ and one mole of an ideal diatomic gas $(\gamma = 7/5)$. Here, $\gamma$ is the ratio of the specific heats at constant pressure and constant volume of an ideal gas. The gas mixture does a work of 66 Joule when heated at constant pressure. The change in its internal energy is \underline{\hspace{3cm}} Joule. \ansint{121}

\begin{solution}
    \begin{align*}
        \intertext{The work done by the gas is given by:}
        W &= nC_p\Delta T\\
        \intertext{The change in internal energy is given by:}
        \Delta U &= nC_v\Delta T\\
        \intertext{Given that the gas mixture does a work of 66 Joule when heated at constant pressure.}
        W &= 66\\
        \intertext{For the mixture of gases,}
        \gamma_{\text{mixture}} &= \dfrac{2}{3} \cdot \dfrac{5}{3} + \dfrac{1}{3} \cdot \dfrac{7}{5}\\
        &= \dfrac{10}{9} + \dfrac{7}{15}\\
        &= \dfrac{50+21}{45}\\
        &= \dfrac{71}{45}\\
        \intertext{The work done by the gas is given by:}
        W &= nC_p\Delta T\\
        \intertext{For the mixture of gases,}
        C_p &= \dfrac{71}{45}R\\
        \intertext{Given that the gas mixture does a work of 66 Joule when heated at constant pressure.}
        66 &= 3 \cdot \dfrac{71}{45} \cdot \Delta T\\
        \Delta T &= \dfrac{66 \cdot 45}{3 \cdot 71}\\
        &= 30\\
        \intertext{The change in internal energy is given by:}
        \Delta U &= nC_v\Delta T\\
        &= 3 \cdot \dfrac{71}{45} \cdot 30\\
        &= 121
        \intertext{Therefore, the change in its internal energy is 121 Joule.}

\item A person of height \(1.6 \, m\) is walking away from a lamp post of height \(4 \, m\) along a straight path on the flat ground. The lamp post and the person are always perpendicular to the ground. If the speed of the person is \(60 \, cm \, s^{-1}\), the speed of the tip of the person's shadow on the ground with respect to the person is \_\_\_\_\_ \(cm \, s^{-1}\). \ansint{40}

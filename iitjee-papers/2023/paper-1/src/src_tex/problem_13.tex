\item Two point-like objects of masses 20 gm and 30 gm are fixed at the two ends of a rigid massless rod of length 10 cm. This system is suspended vertically from a rigid ceiling using a thin wire attached to its center of mass, as shown in the figure. The resulting torsional pendulum undergoes small oscillations. The torsional constant of the wire is \(1.2 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{N m rad}^{-1}\). The angular frequency of the oscillations in \(n \times 10^{-3} \, \text{rad s}^{-1}\). The value of \(n\) is \_\_\_\_\_\_. \ansint{10}

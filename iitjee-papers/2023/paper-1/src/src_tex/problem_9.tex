\item An optical arrangement consists of two concave mirrors \( M_1 \) and \( M_2 \), and a convex lens \( L \) with a common principal axis, as shown in the figure. The focal length of \( L \) is 10 cm. The radii of curvature of \( M_1 \) and \( M_2 \) are 20 cm and 24 cm, respectively. The distance between \( L \) and \( M_2 \) is 20 cm. A point object \( S \) is placed at the mid-point between \( L \) and \( M_2 \) on the axis. When the distance between \( L \) and \( M_1 \) is \( n/7 \) cm, one of the images coincides with \( S \). The value of \( n \) is \_\_\_\_\_. \ansint{220, 80, 150, $\cdots$}

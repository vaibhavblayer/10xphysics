\item An electric dipole is formed by two charges \(+q\) and \(-q\) located in xy-plane at \((0,2)\) mm and \((0,-2)\) mm, respectively, as shown in the figure. The electric potential at point \(P\) \((100,100)\) mm due to the dipole is \(V_0\). The charges \(+q\) and \(-q\) are then moved to the points \((-1,2)\) mm and \((1,-2)\) mm, respectively. What is the value of electric potential at \(P\) due to the new dipole?

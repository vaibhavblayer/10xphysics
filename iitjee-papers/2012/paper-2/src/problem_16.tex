\item A current carrying infinitely long wire is kept along the diameter of a circular wire loop, without touching it. The correct statement(s) is(are)
    \begin{tasks}(1)
        \task The emf induced in the loop is zero if the current is constant.
        \task The emf induced in the loop is finite if the current is constant.
        \task The emf induced in the loop is zero if the current decreases at a steady rate.
        \task The emf induced in the loop is finite if the current decreases at a steady rate.
    \end{tasks}

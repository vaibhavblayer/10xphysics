\item Two solid cylinders \(P\) and \(Q\) of same mass and same radius start rolling down a fixed inclined plane from the same height at the same time. Cylinder \(P\) has most of its mass concentrated near its surface, while \(Q\) has most of its mass concentrated near the axis. Which statement(s) is(are) correct?
    \begin{tasks}(1)
        \task Both cylinders \(P\) and \(Q\) reach the ground at the same time.
        \task Cylinder \(P\) has larger linear acceleration than cylinder \(Q\).
        \task Both cylinders reach the ground with the same translational kinetic energy.
        \task Cylinder \(Q\) reaches the ground with larger angular speed.
    \end{tasks}

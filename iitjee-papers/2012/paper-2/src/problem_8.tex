\item Two identical discs of same radius \( R \) are rotating about their axes in opposite directions with the same constant angular speed \( \omega \). The discs are in the same horizontal plane. At time \( t = 0 \), the points \( P \) and \( Q \) are facing each other as shown in the figure. The relative speed between the two points \( P \) and \( Q \) is \( v_r \). In one time period (\( T \)) of rotation of the discs, \( v_r \), as a function of time is best represented by

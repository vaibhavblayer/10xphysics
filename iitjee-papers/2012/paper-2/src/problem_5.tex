\item Two moles of ideal helium gas are in a rubber balloon at \(30^\circ C\). The balloon is fully expandable and can be assumed to require no energy in its expansion. The temperature of the gas in the balloon is slowly changed to \(35^\circ C\). The amount of heat required in raising the temperature is nearly (take \(R = 8.31 \, \text{J/mol.K}\))

\item Six point charges are kept at the vertices of a regular hexagon of side $L$ and centre $O$, as shown in the figure. Given that $K = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}$, which of the following statement(s) is(are) correct?
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            % Since the actual diagram cannot be replicated in LaTeX without more information, it is represented as a placeholder.
            \node at (0, 0) {Diagram};
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    \begin{tasks}(1)
        \task The electric field at $O$ is $6K$ along $OD$.
        \task The potential at $O$ is zero.
        \task The potential at all points on the line $PR$ is same.
        \task The potential at all points on the line $ST$ is same.
    \end{tasks}

\item A thin uniform cylindrical shell, closed at both ends, is partially filled with water. It is floating vertically in water in half-submerged state. If \(\rho_c\) is the relative density of the material of the shell with respect to water, then the correct statement is that the shell is
    \begin{tasks}(1)
        \task more than half-filled if \(\rho_c\) is less than 0.5.
        \task more than half-filled if \(\rho_c\) is more than 1.0.
        \task half-filled if \(\rho_c\) is more than 0.5.
        \task less than half-filled if \(\rho_c\) is less than 0.5.
    \end{tasks}

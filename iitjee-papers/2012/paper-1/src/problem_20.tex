\item A proton is fired from very far away towards a nucleus with charge \( Q = 120 e \), where \( e \) is the electronic charge. It makes a closest approach of \(10 \text{ fm} \) to the nucleus. The de Broglie wavelength (in units of fm) of the proton at its start is: (take the proton mass, \( m_p = \left(\frac{5}{3}\right) \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg} \); \( h/e = 4.2 \times 10^{-15} \text{ J.s/C} \); \( \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} = 9 \times 10^{9} \text{ m/F} \); \(1 \text{ fm} = 10^{-15} \text{ m}\) )

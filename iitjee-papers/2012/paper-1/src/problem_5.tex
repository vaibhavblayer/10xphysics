\item A small block is connected to one end of a massless spring of un-stretched length $4.9\,m$. The other end of the spring (see the figure) is fixed. The system lies on a horizontal frictionless surface. The block is stretched by $0.2\,m$ and released from rest at $t = 0$. It then executes simple harmonic motion with angular frequency $\omega = \frac{\pi}{3}\,rad/s$. Simultaneously at $t = 0$, a small pebble is projected with speed $v$ from point $P$ at an angle of $45^\circ$ as shown in the figure. Point $P$ is at a horizontal distance of $10\,m$ from $O$. If the pebble hits the block at $t = 1\,s$, the value of $v$ is (take $g = 10\,m/s^2$)

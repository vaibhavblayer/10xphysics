\item A person blows into open-end of a long pipe. As a result, a high-pressure pulse of air travels down the pipe. When this pulse reaches the other end of the pipe,
    \begin{tasks}(2)
        \task a high-pressure pulse starts traveling up the pipe, if the other end of the pipe is open.
        \task a low-pressure pulse starts traveling up the pipe, if the other end of the pipe is open.
        \task a low-pressure pulse starts traveling up the pipe, if the other end of the pipe is closed.
        \task a high-pressure pulse starts traveling up the pipe, if the other end of the pipe is closed.

\item An infinitely long solid cylinder of radius $R$ has a uniform volume charge density $\rho$. It has a spherical cavity of radius $R/2$ with its centre on the axis of the cylinder, as shown in the figure. The magnitude of the electric field at the point $P$, which is at a distance $2R$ from the axis of the cylinder, is given by the expression $\frac{23\rho R}{16k\epsilon_0}$. The value of $k$ is \underline{\hspace{2.5cm}}.

\item Consider the motion of a positive point charge in a region where there are simultaneous uniform electric and magnetic fields $\vec{E} = E_0 \hat{j}$ and $\vec{B} = B_0 \hat{j}$. At time $t = 0$, this charge has velocity $\vec{v}$ in the x-y plane, making an angle $\theta$ with the x-axis. Which of the following option(s) is(are) correct for time $t > 0$?
    \begin{tasks}(2)
        \task If $\theta = 0^\circ$, the charge moves in a circular path in the x-z plane.
        \task If $\theta = 0^\circ$, the charge undergoes helical motion with constant pitch along the y-axis.
        \task If $\theta = 10^\circ$, the charge undergoes helical motion with its pitch increasing with time, along the y-axis.
        \task If $\theta = 90^\circ$, the charge undergoes linear but accelerated motion along the y-axis.
    \end{tasks}

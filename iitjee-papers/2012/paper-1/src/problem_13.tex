\item A small block of mass of \(0.1~\text{kg}\) lies on a fixed inclined plane \(PQ\) which makes an angle \(\theta\) with the horizontal. A horizontal force of \(1~\text{N}\) acts on the block through its center of mass as shown in the figure. The block remains stationary if \((\text{take } g = 10~\text{m/s}^2)\)

        \task \(\theta > 45^\circ\) and a frictional force acts on the block towards \(P\).
        \task \(\theta > 45^\circ\) and a frictional force acts on the block towards \(Q\).

\item A small mass $m$ is attached to a massless string whose other end is fixed at $P$ as shown in the figure. The mass is undergoing circular motion in the $x$-$y$ plane with centre at $O$ and constant angular speed $\omega$. If the angular momentum of the system, calculated about $O$ and $P$ are denoted by $\vec{L}_O$ and $\vec{L}_P$ respectively, then
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            % This is where you would draw the diagram from the image, a simplified representation is given
            \coordinate (O) at (0,0);
            \coordinate (P) at (0,2);
            \coordinate (M) at (1.5,0);
            \draw[dashed] (O) -- node[left] {$P$} (P);
            \draw[dashed] (O) -- (M);
            \draw (M) circle (0.2cm);
            \draw[->] (M) -- ++(-0.3,-0.3) node[below] {$\omega$};

            \fill (P) circle (1pt);

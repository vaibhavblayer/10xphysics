\item A circular wire loop of radius \( R \) is placed in the x-y plane centered at the origin \( O \). A square loop of side \( a \) (\( a \ll R \)) having two turns is placed with its center at \( z = \sqrt{3} R \) along the axis of the circular wire loop, as shown in figure. The plane of the square loop makes an angle of \( 45^\circ \) with respect to the z-axis. If the mutual inductance between the loops is given by \( \frac{\mu_0 a^2}{2 \rho^{3/2} R} \), then the value of \( \rho \) is

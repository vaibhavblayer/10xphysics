\item In the determination of Young's modulus $\left( Y = \frac{4ML}{\pi d^2} \right)$ by using Searle's method, a wire of length $L = 2$ m and diameter $d = 0.5$ mm is used. For a load $M = 2.5$ kg, an extension $l = 0.25$ mm in the length of the wire is observed. Quantities $d$ and $l$ are measured using a screw gauge and a micrometer, respectively. They have the same pitch of 0.5 mm. The number of divisions on their circular scale is 100. The contributions to the maximum probable error of the $Y$ measurement

\begin{tasks}(2)
\task due to the errors in the measurements of $d$ and $l$ are the same.
\task due to the error in the measurement of $d$ is twice that due to the error in the measurement of $l$.
\task due to the error in the measurement of $l$ is twice that due to the error in the measurement of $d$.
\task due to the error in the measurement of $d$ is four times that due to the error in the measurement of $l$.

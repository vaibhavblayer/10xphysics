\item A thin uniform rod, pivoted at \( O \), is rotating in the horizontal plane with constant angular speed \( \omega \), as shown in the figure. At time \( t = 0 \), a small insect starts from \( O \) and moves with constant speed \( v \) with respect to the rod towards the other end. It reaches the end of the rod at \( t = T \) and stops. The angular speed of the system remains \( \omega \) throughout. The magnitude of the torque (\( |\vec{\tau}| \)) on the system about \( O \), as a function of time is best represented by which plot?

\item Young's double slit experiment is carried out by using green, red and blue light, one color at a time. The fringe widths recorded are \(\beta_G\), \(\beta_R\) and \(\beta_B\), respectively. Then,
    \begin{tasks}(2)
        \task \(\beta_G > \beta_B > \beta_R\)
        \task \(\beta_B > \beta_G > \beta_R\)
        \task \(\beta_R > \beta_B > \beta_G\)
        \task \(\beta_R > \beta_G > \beta_B\)
    \end{tasks}

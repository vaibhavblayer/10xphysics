\item Two large vertical and parallel metal plates having a separation of 1 cm are connected to a DC voltage source of potential difference \(X\). A proton is released at rest midway between the two plates. It is found to move at \(45^\circ\) to the vertical JUST after release. Then \(X\) is nearly

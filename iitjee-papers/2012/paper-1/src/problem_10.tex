\item A bi-convex lens is formed with two thin plano-convex lenses as shown in the figure. Refractive index \( n \) of the first lens is 1.5 and that of the second lens is 1.2. Both the curved surfaces are of the same radius of curvature \( R = 14 \) cm. For this bi-convex lens, for an object distance of 40 cm, the image distance will be

\item A parallel plate capacitor having plates of area \( S \) and plate separation \( d \), has capacitance \( C_1 \) in air. When two dielectrics of different relative permittivities \( (\varepsilon_1 = 2 \) and \( \varepsilon_2 = 4) \) are introduced between the two plates as shown in the figure, the capacitance becomes \( C_2 \). The ratio \( \frac{C_2}{C_1} \) is

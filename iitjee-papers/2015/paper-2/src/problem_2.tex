    \item The energy of a system as a function of time $t$ is given as $E(t) = A^2 \exp(-\alpha t)$, where $\alpha = 0.2\ s^{-1}$. The measurement of $A$ has an error of 1.25\%. If the error in the measurement of time is 1.50\%, the percentage error in the value of $E(t)$ at $t = 5\ s$ is \underline{\hspace{2.5 cm}}.

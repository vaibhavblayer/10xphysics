    \item A Young's double slit interference arrangement with slits $S_1$ and $S_2$ is immersed in water (refractive index = 4/3) as shown in the figure. The positions of maxima on the surface of water are given by $x^2 = p^2m^2\lambda^2 - d^2$, where $\lambda$ is the wavelength of light in air (refractive index = 1), $2d$ is the separation between the slits and $m$ is an integer. The value of $p$ is \underline{\hspace{2.5 cm}}.

    \item In an aluminum (Al) bar of square cross section, a square hole is drilled and is filled with iron (Fe) as shown in the figure. The electrical resistivities of Al and Fe are \(2.7 \times 10^{-8}\ \Omega m\) and \(1.0 \times 10^{-7}\ \Omega m\), respectively. The electrical resistance between the two faces P and Q of the composite bar is

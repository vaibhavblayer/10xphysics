    \begin{tasks}(1)
        \task The average energy per mole of the gas mixture is \( 2RT \).
        \task The ratio of speed of sound in the gas mixture to that in helium gas is \( \sqrt{\frac{6}{5}} \).
        \task The ratio of the rms speed of helium atoms to that of hydrogen molecules is \( \frac{1}{2} \).

    \end{tasks}

    \begin{solution}
        \begin{align*}
            \intertext{The average energy of gas mixture can be found using the formula for internal energy of an ideal gas, which is \( U = nC_vT \).}
            \text{Average energy per mole of mixture} &= \frac{U_{\text{H}_2} + U_{\text{He}}}{2}\\
            &= \frac{C_{v_{H_2}}T + C_{v_{He}}T}{2}\\
            &= \frac{\frac{5}{2}RT + \frac{3}{2}RT}{2}\\
            &= \frac{4RT}{2}\\
            &= 2RT\\
            \intertext{Therefore, option (a) is correct.}
            \intertext{The ratio of speed of sound in the gas mixture to that in helium gas can be found using the formula \( v = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma RT}{M}} \), where \( \gamma \) is the heat capacity ratio, \( R \) is the gas constant, \( T \) is the temperature, and \( M \) is the molar mass. For a mixture of gases, \( \gamma \) and \( M \) are averages.}
            \text{Speed of sound in mixture} &= \sqrt{\frac{\gamma RT}{M}}\\
            \text{Speed of sound in helium} &= \sqrt{\frac{\gamma_{\text{He}}RT}{M_{\text{He}}}}\\
            \text{Ratio of speeds} &= \frac{\sqrt{\frac{\gamma RT}{M}}}{\sqrt{\frac{\gamma_{\text{He}}RT}{M_{\text{He}}}}}\\
            &= \sqrt{\frac{M_{\text{He}}}{M} \cdot \frac{\gamma}{\gamma_{\text{He}}}}\\
            &= \sqrt{\frac{4}{2} \cdot \frac{5}{3}}\\
            &= \sqrt{\frac{6}{5}}\\
            \intertext{The ratio of the rms speed of helium atoms to that of hydrogen molecules can be found using the formula for rms speed, which is \( v_{\text{rms}} = \sqrt{\frac{3RT}{M}} \).}
            v_{\text{rms He}} &= \sqrt{\frac{3RT}{M_{\text{He}}}}\\
            v_{\text{rms H}_2} &= \sqrt{\frac{3RT}{M_{\text{H}_2}}}\\
            \text{Ratio of rms speeds} &= \frac{\sqrt{\frac{3RT}{M_{\text{He}}}}}{\sqrt{\frac{3RT}{M_{\text{H}_2}}}}\\
            &= \sqrt{\frac{M_{\text{H}_2}}{M_{\text{He}}}}\\
            &= \sqrt{\frac{2}{4}}\\
            &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\\
            \intertext{Option (d) is correct. Option (c) is incorrect.}

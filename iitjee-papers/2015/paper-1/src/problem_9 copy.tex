\item Consider a Vernier callipers in which each 1 cm on the main scale is divided into 8 equal divisions and a screw gauge with 100 divisions on its circular scale. In the Vernier callipers, 5 divisions of the Vernier scale coincide with 4 divisions on the main scale and in the screw gauge, one complete rotation of the circular scale moves it by two divisions on the linear scale. Then:
    \begin{tasks}(1)
        \task If the pitch of the screw gauge is twice the least count of the Vernier callipers, the least count of the screw gauge is 0.01 mm.
        \task If the pitch of the screw gauge is twice the least count of the Vernier callipers, the least count of the screw gauge is 0.005 mm.
        \task If the least count of the linear scale of the screw gauge is twice the least count of the Vernier callipers, the least count of the screw gauge is 0.01 mm.
        \task If the least count of the linear scale of the screw gauge is twice the least count of the Vernier callipers, the least count of the screw gauge is 0.005 mm.
    \end{tasks}

    \begin{solution}
        \begin{align*}
            \intertext{The least count (LC) of the Vernier calipers can be found using the given information:}
            \text{LC of Vernier calipers} &= \frac{\text{1 MSD}}{\text{Total number of VSD}} - \frac{\text{Value of 1 corresponding VSD}}{\text{Total number of VSD}} \\
            &= \frac{1\, cm}{8} - \frac{4\, cm}{5 \times 8} \\
            &= \frac{1}{8} - \frac{1}{10} \\
            &= \frac{5-4}{40} \\
            &= \frac{1}{40}\, cm \\
            &= 0.025\, cm
            \intertext{Given that the pitch of the screw gauge is twice the least count of the Vernier calipers:}
            \text{Pitch of screw gauge} &= 2 \times 0.025\, cm \\
            &= 0.05\, cm
            \intertext{Since one complete rotation of the circular scale moves it by two divisions on the linear scale:}
            \text{Least count (LC) of the screw gauge} &= \frac{\text{Pitch of the screw gauge}}{\text{Total number of divisions on the circular scale}} \\
            &= \frac{0.05\, cm}{100} \\
            &= 0.0005\, cm \\
            &= 0.005\, mm
            \intertext{Therefore, Option (b) is the correct answer.}
        \end{align*}

    \item An infinitely long uniform line charge distribution of charge per unit length $\lambda$ lies parallel to the y-axis in the y-z plane at $z = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}a$ (see figure). If the magnitude of the flux of the electric field through the rectangular surface $ABCD$ lying in the x-y plane with its centre at the origin is $\frac{\lambda L}{n\epsilon_0}$ ($\epsilon_0$ = permittivity of free space), then the value of $n$ is \underline{\hspace{2.5 cm}}.

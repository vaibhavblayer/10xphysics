    \item The position vector \(\vec{r}\) of a particle of mass \(m\) is given by the following equation \[\vec{r}(t) = \alpha t^3 \vec{i} + \beta t^2 \vec{j},\] where \(\alpha=\frac{10}{3}\) m s\(^{-3}\), \(\beta = 5\) m s\(^{-2}\) and \(m=0.1\) kg. At \(t=1\) s, which of the following statement(s) is(are) true about the particle?

            \task The velocity \(\vec{v}\) is given by \(\vec{v} = (10\vec{i} + 10\vec{j})\) ms\(^{-1}\)
            \task The angular momentum \(\vec{L}\) with respect to the origin is given by \(\vec{L} = -\left(\frac{5}{3}\right) \vec{k}\) Nm s
            \task The force \(\vec{F}\) is given by \(\vec{F} = (\vec{i} + 2\vec{j})\)N
            \task The torque \(\vec{\tau}\) with respect to the origin is given by \(\vec{\tau} = -\left(\frac{20}{3}\right) \vec{k}\) Nm

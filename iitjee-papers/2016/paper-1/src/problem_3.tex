\begin{enumerate}
    \item A water cooler of storage capacity \( 120 \) litres can cool water at a constant rate of \( P \) watts. In a closed circulation system (as shown schematically in the figure), the water from the cooler is used to cool an external device that generates constantly \( 3 \) kW of heat (thermal load). The temperature of water fed into the device cannot exceed \( 30^\circ\text{C} \) and the entire stored \( 120 \) litres of water is initially cooled to \( 10^\circ\text{C} \). The entire system is thermally insulated. The minimum value of \( P \) (in watts) for which the device can be operated for \( 3 \) hours is

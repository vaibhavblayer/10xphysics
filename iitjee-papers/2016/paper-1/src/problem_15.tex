\begin{enumerate}
    \item The isotope $^{12}_{5}B$ having a mass $12.014 \ u$ undergoes $\beta$-decay to $^{12}_{6}C$. $^{12}_{6}C$ has an excited state of the nucleus $^{12}_{6}C^*$ at $4.041 \ MeV$ above its ground state. If $^{12}_{5}B$ decays to $^{12}_{6}C^*$, the maximum kinetic energy of the $\beta$-particle in units of $MeV$ is \underline{\hspace{2.5 cm}} ($1 \ u = 931.5 \ MeV/c^2$, where $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum).

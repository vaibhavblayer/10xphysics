\begin{enumerate}
    \item An infinite line charge of uniform electric charge density $\lambda$ lies along the axis of an electrically conducting infinite cylindrical shell of radius $R$. At time $t = 0$, the space inside the cylinder is filled with a material of permittivity $\epsilon$ and electrical conductivity $\sigma$. The electrical conduction in the material follows Ohm's law. Which one of the following graphs best describes the subsequent variation of the magnitude of current density $j(t)$ at any point in the material?

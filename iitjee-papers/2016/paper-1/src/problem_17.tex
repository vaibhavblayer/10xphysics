\begin{enumerate}
    \item Consider two solid spheres P and Q each of density 8 gm cm$^{-3}$ and diameters 1 cm and 0.5 cm, respectively. Sphere P is dropped into a liquid of density 0.8 gm cm$^{-3}$ and viscosity $\eta=3$ poiseuilles. Sphere Q is dropped into a liquid of density 1.6 gm cm$^{-3}$ and viscosity $\eta=2$ poiseuilles. The ratio of the terminal velocities of P and Q is \underline{\hspace{2.5 cm}}.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Two inductors $L_1$ (inductance 1 mH, internal resistance 3 $\Omega$) and $L_2$ (inductance 2 mH, internal resistance 4 $\Omega$), and a resistor $R$ (resistance 12 $\Omega$) are all connected in parallel across a 5 V battery. The circuit is switched on at time $t = 0$. The ratio of the maximum to the minimum current ($\frac{I_{\text{max}}}{I_{\text{min}}}$) drawn from the battery is \underline{\hspace{2.5 cm}}.

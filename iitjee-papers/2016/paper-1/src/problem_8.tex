\begin{enumerate}
    \item An incandescent bulb has a thin filament of tungsten that is heated to high temperature by passing an electric current. The hot filament emits black-body radiation. The filament is observed to break up at random locations after a sufficiently long time of operation due to non-uniform evaporation of tungsten from the filament. If the bulb is powered at constant voltage, which of the following statement(s) is(are) true?
        \begin{tasks}(1)
            \task The temperature distribution over the filament is uniform
            \task The resistance over small sections of the filament decreases with time
            \task The filament emits more light at higher band of frequencies before it breaks up
            \task The filament consumes less electrical power towards the end of the life of the bulb
        \end{tasks}
\end{enumerate}

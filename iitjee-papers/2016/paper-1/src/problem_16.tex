\begin{enumerate}
    \item A hydrogen atom in its ground state is irradiated by light of wavelength 970 \AA. Taking $\frac{hc}{e} = 1.237 \times 10^{-6}$ eV m and the ground state energy of hydrogen atom as $-13.6$ eV, the number of lines present in the emission spectrum is \underline{\hspace{2.5 cm}}.

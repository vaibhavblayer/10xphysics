\begin{enumerate}
    \item A uniform wooden stick of mass 1.6 kg and length \( l \) rests in an inclined manner on a smooth, vertical wall of height \( h (< l) \) such that a small portion of the stick extends beyond the wall. The reaction force of the wall on the stick is perpendicular to the stick. The stick makes an angle of 30\(^{\circ}\) with the wall and the bottom of the stick is on a rough floor. The reaction of the wall on the stick is equal in magnitude to the reaction of the floor on the stick. The ratio \( \frac{h}{l} \) and the frictional force \( f \) at the bottom of the stick are (\( g = 10 \) m s\(^{-2}\))
        \begin{tasks}(2)
            \task \( \frac{h}{l} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{16}, f = \frac{16\sqrt{3}}{3} \) N
            \task \( \frac{h}{l} = \frac{3}{16}, f = \frac{16\sqrt{3}}{3} \) N
            \task \( \frac{h}{l} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{16}, f = \frac{8\sqrt{3}}{3} \) N
            \task \( \frac{h}{l} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{16}, f = \frac{16\sqrt{3}}{3} \) N
        \end{tasks}
\end{enumerate}

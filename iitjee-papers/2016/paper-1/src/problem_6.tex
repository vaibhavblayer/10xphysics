\begin{enumerate}
    \item Highly excited states for hydrogen-like atoms (also called Rydberg states) with nuclear charge \( Ze \) are defined by their principal quantum number \( n \), where \( n \gg 1 \). Which of the following statement(s) is(are) true?
        \begin{tasks}(1)
            \task Relative change in the radii of two consecutive orbitals does not depend on \( Z \)
            \task Relative change in the radii of two consecutive orbitals varies as \( 1/n \)
            \task Relative change in the energy of two consecutive orbitals varies as \( 1/n^3 \)
            \task Relative change in the angular momenta of two consecutive orbitals varies as \( 1/n \)
        \end{tasks}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item In the circuit shown below, the key is pressed at time \( t = 0 \). Which of the following statement(s) is(are) true?
        \begin{tasks}(1)
            \task The voltmeter displays \( -5 \) V as soon as the key is pressed, and displays \( +5 \) V after a long time
            \task The voltmeter will display 0 V at time \( t = \ln 2 \) seconds
            \task The current in the ammeter becomes \( \frac{1}{e} \) of the initial value after 1 second
            \task The current in the ammeter becomes zero after a long time
        \end{tasks}

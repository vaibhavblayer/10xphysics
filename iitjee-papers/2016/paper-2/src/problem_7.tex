\begin{enumerate}
    \item Two thin circular discs of mass \( m \) and \( 4m \), having radii of \( a \) and \( 2a \), respectively, are rigidly fixed by a massless, rigid rod of length \( l = \sqrt{24} a \) through their centers. This assembly is laid on a firm and flat surface, and set rolling without slipping on the surface so that the angular speed about the axis of the rod is \( \omega \). The angular momentum of the entire assembly about the point 'O' is \( \vec{L} \) (see the figure). Which of the following statement(s) is(are) true?
        \begin{tasks}(2)
            \task The center of mass of the assembly rotates about the z-axis with an angular speed of \( \omega/5 \)
            \task The magnitude of angular momentum of center of mass of the assembly about the point O is \( 81ma^2\omega \)
            \task The magnitude of angular momentum of the assembly about its center of mass is \( 17ma^2\omega/2 \)
            \task The magnitude of the z-component of \( \vec{L} \) is \( 55ma^2\omega \)
        \end{tasks}

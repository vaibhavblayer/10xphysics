\begin{enumerate}
    \item A gas is enclosed in a cylinder with a movable frictionless piston. Its initial thermodynamic state at pressure \(P_i = 10^5\) Pa and volume \(V_i = 10^{-3}\ m^3\) changes to a final state at \(P_f = (1/32) \times 10^5\) Pa and \(V_f = 8 \times 10^{-3}\ m^3\) in an adiabatic quasi-static process, such that \(P V^{5} =\) constant. Consider another thermodynamic process that brings the system from the same initial state to the same final state in two steps: an isobaric expansion at \(P_i\), followed by an isochoric (isovolumetric) process at volume \(V_f\). The amount of heat supplied to the system in the two-step process is approximately

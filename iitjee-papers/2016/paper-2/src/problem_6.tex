    \item There are two Vernier calipers both of which have 1 cm divided into 10 equal divisions on the main scale. The Vernier scale of one of the calipers (\( C_1 \)) has 10 equal divisions that correspond to 9 main scale divisions. The Vernier scale of the other caliper (\( C_2 \)) has 10 equal divisions that correspond to 11 main scale divisions. The readings of the two calipers are shown in the figure. The measured values (in cm) by calipers \( C_1 \) and \( C_2 \), respectively, are

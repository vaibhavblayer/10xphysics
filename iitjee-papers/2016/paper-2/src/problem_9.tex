\begin{enumerate}
    \item In an experiment to determine the acceleration due to gravity \( g \), the formula used for the time period of a periodic motion is \( T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{l(R-r)}{5g}} \). The values of \( R \) and \( r \) are measured to be \( (60 \pm 1) \) mm and \( (10 \pm 1) \) mm, respectively. In five successive measurements, the time period is found to be 0.52 s, 0.56 s, 0.57 s, 0.54 s and 0.59 s. The least count of the watch used for the measurement of time period is 0.01 s. Which of the following statement(s) is(are) true?
        \begin{tasks}(2)
            \task The error in the measurement of \( r \) is 10\%
            \task The error in the measurement of \( T \) is 3.57\%
            \task The error in the measurement of \( T' \) is 2\%
            \task The error in the determined value of \( g \) is 11\%
        \end{tasks}

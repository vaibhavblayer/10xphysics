\begin{enumerate}
    \item Light of wavelength $\lambda_{ph}$ falls on a cathode plate inside a vacuum tube as shown in the figure. The work function of the cathode surface is $\phi$ and the anode is a wire mesh of conducting material kept at a distance $d$ from the cathode. A potential difference $V$ is maintained between the electrodes. If the minimum de Broglie wavelength of the electrons passing through the anode is $\lambda_e$, which of the following statement(s) is(are) true?
        \begin{tasks}(1)
            \task $\lambda_e$ decreases with increase in $\phi$ and $\lambda_{ph}$
            \task $\lambda_e$ is approximately halved, if $d$ is doubled
            \task For large potential difference ($V \gg \phi/e$), $\lambda_e$ is approximately halved if $V$ is made four times
            \task $\lambda_e$ increases at the same rate as $\lambda_{ph}$ for $\lambda_{ph} < hc/\phi$
        \end{tasks}

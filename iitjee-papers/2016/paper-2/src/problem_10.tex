\begin{enumerate}
    \item Consider two identical galvanometers and two identical resistors with resistance \( R \). If the internal resistance of the galvanometers \( R_C < R/2 \), which of the following statement(s) about any one of the galvanometers is(are) true?
        \begin{tasks}(2)
            \task The maximum voltage range is obtained when all the components are connected in series
            \task The maximum voltage range is obtained when the two resistors and one galvanometer are connected in series, and the second galvanometer is connected in parallel to the first galvanometer
            \task The maximum current range is obtained when all the components are connected in parallel
            \task The maximum current range is obtained when the two galvanometers are connected in series and the combination is connected in parallel with both the resistors

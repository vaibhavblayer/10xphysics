    \item While conducting the Young's double slit experiment, a student replaced the two slits with a large opaque plate in the x-y plane containing two small holes that act as two coherent point sources (\(S_1, S_2\)) emitting light of wavelength 600 nm. The student mistakenly placed the screen parallel to the x-z plane (for \(z > 0\)) at a distance \(D = 3 m\) from the mid-point of \(S_1S_2\), as shown schematically in the figure. The distance between the sources \(d = 0.6003 mm\). The origin \(O\) is at the intersection of the screen and the line joining \(S_1S_2\). Which of the following is(are) true of the intensity pattern on the screen?
        \begin{tasks}(1)
            \task Straight bright and dark bands parallel to the x-axis
            \task The region very close to the point \(O\) will be dark
            \task Hyperbolic bright and dark bands with foci symmetrically placed about \(O\) in the x-direction
            \task Semi circular bright and dark bands centered at point \(O\)
        \end{tasks}

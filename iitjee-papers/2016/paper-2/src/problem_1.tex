\begin{enumerate}
    \item The electrostatic energy of \(Z\) protons uniformly distributed throughout a spherical nucleus of radius \(R\) is given by
    \[
    E = \frac{3}{5} \frac{Z(Z-1)e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 R}
    \]
    The measured masses of the neutron, \( ^1H\), \( ^{15}N \) and \( ^{15}O \) are \(1.008665 \, u\), \(1.007825 \, u\), \(15.000109 \, u\) and \(15.003065 \, u\), respectively. Given that the radii of both the \( ^{15}N \) and \( ^{15}O \) nuclei are same, \(1 \, u = 931.5 \, MeV/c^2\) (\(c\) is the speed of light) and \(e^2/(4\pi\varepsilon_0) = 1.44 \, MeV\,fm\). Assuming that the difference between the binding energies of \( ^{15}N \) and \( ^{15}O \) is purely due to the electrostatic energy, the radius of either of the nuclei is

    (1 fm = \(10^{-15}\) m)

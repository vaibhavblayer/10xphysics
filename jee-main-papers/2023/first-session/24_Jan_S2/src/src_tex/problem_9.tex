\item An $\alpha$-particle, a proton and an electron have the same kinetic energy. Which one of the following is correct in case of their de-Broglie wavelength:
\begin{tasks}(2)
    \task $\lambda_{\alpha} < \lambda_p < \lambda_e$
    \task $\lambda_{\alpha} > \lambda_p < \lambda_e$
    \task $\lambda_{\alpha} = \lambda_p = \lambda_e$
    \task $\lambda_{\alpha} > \lambda_p > \lambda_e$
\end{tasks}

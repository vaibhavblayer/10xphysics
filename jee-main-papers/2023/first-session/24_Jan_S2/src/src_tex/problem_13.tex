\item A body of mass 200g is tied to a spring constant 12.5 N/m, while the other end of spring is fixed at point O. If the body moves about O in a circular path on a smooth horizontal surface with constant angular speed 5 rad/s. Then the ratio of extension in the spring to its natural length will be:

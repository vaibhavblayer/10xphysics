\item Three identical resistors with resistance \( R = 12 \Omega \) and two identical inductors with self inductance \( L = 5 \text{ mH} \) are connected to an ideal battery with emf of 12 V shown in figure. The current through the battery long after the switch has been closed will be \underline{\hspace{2.5cm}} A.

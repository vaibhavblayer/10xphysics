\item A uniform solid cylinder with radius R and length L has moment inertia $I_1$, about the axis of the cylinder. A concentric solid cylinder of radius $R' = \frac{R}{2}$ and length $L' = \frac{L}{2}$ is carved out of the original cylinder. If $I_2$ is the moment of inertia of the carved out portion of the cylinder then $\frac{I_1}{I_2}$ =

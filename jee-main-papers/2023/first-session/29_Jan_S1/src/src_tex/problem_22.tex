\item A parallel plate capacitor with air between the plate has a capacitance of 15pF. The separation between the plate become twice and the space between them is filled with a medium of dielectric constant 3.5. Then the capacitance becomes $\frac{x}{4}$ pF. The value of x is \underline{\hspace{2.5cm}}.

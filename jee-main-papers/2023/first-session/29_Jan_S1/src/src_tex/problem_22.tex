\item A point charge \( q_1 = 4q_0 \) is placed at origin. Another point charge \( q_2 = -q_0 \) is placed at \( x = 12 \text{ cm} \). Charge of proton is \( q_0 \). The proton is placed on x axis so that the electrostatic force on the proton is zero. In this situation, the position of the proton from origin is \underline{\hspace{2.5cm}} cm.

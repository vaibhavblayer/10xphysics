\item Given below are two statements: One is labeled as \textbf{Assertion A} and the other is labeled as \textbf{Reason R}. 
\newline
\textbf{Assertion A}: If dQ and dW represent the heat supplied to the system and the work done on the system respectively. Then according to the first law of thermodynamics \( \mathrm{dQ = dU - dW} \).
\newline
\textbf{Reason R}: First law of thermodynamics is based on law of conservation of energy.
\newline
In the light of the above statements, choose the correct answer from the options given below:
\begin{tasks}(1)
    \task (A) A is not correct but R is correct
    \task (B) Both A and R are correct but R is not the correct explanation of A
    \task (C) Both A and R are correct and R is the correct explanation of A
    \task (D) A is correct but R is not correct
\end{tasks}

\item A Spherical ball of radius 1mm and density 10.5g/cc is dropped in glycerine of coefficient of viscosity 9.8 poise and density 1.5 g/cc. Viscous force on the ball when it attains constant velocity is $3696 \times 10^{-x}$ N. The value of x is (Given, $g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^{2}$ and $\pi = \frac{22}{7}$).

\item A single turn current loop in the shape of a right angle triangle with sides 5cm, 12cm, 13cm is carrying a current of 2A. The loop is in a uniform magnetic field of magnitude 0.75 T whose direction is parallel to the current in the 13cm side of the loop. The magnitude of the magnetic force on the 5cm side will be $\frac{x}{130}$ N. The value of x is \underline{\hspace{2.5cm}}.

\item A single current carrying loop of wire carrying current I flowing in anticlockwise direction seen from +ve z direction and lying in xy plane is shown in figure. The plot of $\hat{j }$ component of magnetic field (\(By\)) at a distance ‘\(a\)’ (less than radius of the coil) and on yz plane vs z coordinate looks like

\item In a Young's double slit experiment, two slits are illuminated with a light of wavelength 800nm. The line joining \( A_1 P \) is perpendicular to \( A_1 A_2 \) as shown in the figure. If the first minimum is detected at \( P \), the value of slits separation 'a' will be:
The distance of screen from slits \( D = 5 \, \text{cm} \)

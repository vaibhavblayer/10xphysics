\item In a cuboid of dimension \(2L \times 2L \times L\), a charge \(q\) is placed at the centre of the surface ‘S’ having area of \(4L^2\). The flux through the opposite surface to ‘S’ is given by
\begin{tasks}(2)
    \task \(\dfrac{q}{6\epsilon_0}\)
    \task \(\dfrac{q}{2\epsilon_0}\)
    \task \(\dfrac{q}{3\epsilon_0}\)
    \task \(\dfrac{q}{12\epsilon_0}\)
\end{tasks}

\item A certain elastic conducting material is stretched into a circular loop. It is placed with its plane perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field B = 0.8 T. When released the radius of the loop starts shrinking at a constant rate of 2 cm s\textsuperscript{-1}. The induced emf in the loop at an instant when the radius of the loop is 10 cm will be \underline{\hspace{2.5cm}} mV.

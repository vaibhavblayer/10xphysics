\item Assume that the earth is a solid sphere of uniform density and a tunnel is dug along its diameter throughout the earth. It is found that when a particle is released in this tunnel, it executes a simple harmonic motion. The mass of the particle is 100g. The time period of the motion of the particle will be (approximately) (Take g = 10ms\textsuperscript{-2}, radius of earth = 6400 km)

\item Given below are two statements: one is labelled as Assertion A and the other is labelled as Reason R
\begin{itemize}
    \item Assertion A: Photodiodes are used in forward bias usually for measuring the light intensity.
    \item Reason R: For a p-n junction diode, at applied voltage V the current in the forward bias is more than the current in the reverse bias for \(|V_z| > \pm V \geq |V_0|\) where \(V_0\) is the threshold voltage and \(V_z\) is the breakdown voltage.
\end{itemize}
In the light of the above statements, choose the correct answer from the options given below.
\begin{tasks}(1)
    \task A is true but R is false
    \task Both A and R are true and R is correct explanation A
    \task Both A and R are true but R is NOT the correct explanation A.   
    \task A is false but R is true
\end{tasks}

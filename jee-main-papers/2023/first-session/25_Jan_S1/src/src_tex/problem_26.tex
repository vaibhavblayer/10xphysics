\item A ray of light is incident from air on a glass plate having thickness $\sqrt{3}$ cm and refractive index $\sqrt{2}$. The angle of incidence of a ray is equal to the critical angle for glass-air interface. The lateral displacement of the ray when it passes through the plate is \underline{\hspace{2.5 cm}}. $\times 10^{-2}$ cm. (given $\sin 15^\circ = 0.26$).

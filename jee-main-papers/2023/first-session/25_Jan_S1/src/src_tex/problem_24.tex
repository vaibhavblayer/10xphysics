\item A uniform electric field of 10 N/C is created between two parallel charge plates (as shown in figure). An electron enters the field symmetrically between the plates with a kinetic energy 0.5 eV. The length of each plate is 10cm. The angle (\(\theta\)) of deviation of the path of electron as it comes out of the field is \underline{\hspace{2.5cm}} (in degree).

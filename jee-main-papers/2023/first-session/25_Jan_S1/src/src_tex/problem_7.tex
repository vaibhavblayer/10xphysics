\item Electron beam used in an electron microscope, when accelerated by a voltage of 20kV, has a de-Broglie wavelength of \( \lambda_0 \). If the voltage is increased to 40kV, then the de-Broglie wavelength associated with the electron beam would be:
    \begin{tasks}(2)
        \task \( \frac{\lambda_0}{\sqrt{2}} \)
        \task \( \frac{\lambda_0}{2} \)
        \task \( 9 \lambda_0 \)
        \task \( 3 \lambda_0 \)
    \end{tasks}

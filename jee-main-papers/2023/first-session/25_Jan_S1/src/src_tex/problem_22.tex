\item As shown in the figure, in an experiment to determine Young’s modulus of a wire, the extension-load curve is plotted. The curve is a straight line passing through the origin and makes an angle of \(45^\circ\) with the load axis. The length of wire is 62.8cm and its diameter is 4mm. The Young’s modulus is found to be \(x \times 10^4 \text{Nm}^{-2}\). The value of \(x\) is \underline{\hspace{2.5cm}}.

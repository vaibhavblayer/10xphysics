\item A uniform metallic wire carries a current 2A, when 3.4V battery is connected across it. The mass of uniform metallic wire is \(8.92 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{kg/m}^3\), density is \(8.92 \times 10^{3} \, \text{kg/m}^3\) and resistivity is \(1.7 \times 10^{-8} \, \Omega - \text{m}\). The length of wire is:
\begin{tasks}(2)
    \task \(\ell = 100 \, \text{m}\)
    \task \(\ell = 5 \, \text{m}\)
    \task \(\ell = 10 \, \text{m}\)
    \task \(\ell = 6.8 \, \text{m}\)
\end{tasks}

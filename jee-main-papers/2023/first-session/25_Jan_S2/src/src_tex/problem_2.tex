\item For a moving coil galvanometer, the deflection in the coil is 0.05 rad when a current of 10 mA is passed through it. If the torsional constant of suspension wire is $4.0 \times 10^{-5}$ N m rad$^{-1}$, the magnetic field is 0.01 T and the number of turns in the coil is 200, the area of each turn (in cm$^2$) is:

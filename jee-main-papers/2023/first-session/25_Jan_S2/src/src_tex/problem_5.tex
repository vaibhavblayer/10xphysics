\item Consider a block kept on an inclined plane (inclined at 45Â°) as shown in the figure. If the force required to just push it up the incline is 2 times the force required to just prevent it from sliding down, the coefficient of friction between the block and inclined plane (\(\mu\)) is equal to:

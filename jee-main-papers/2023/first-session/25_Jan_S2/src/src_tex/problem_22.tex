\item Two long parallel wires carrying currents 8A and 15A in opposite directions are placed at a distance of 7cm from each other. A point P is at equidistant from both the wires such that lines joining the point P to the wire are perpendicular to each other. The magnitude of magnetic field at P is \underline{\hspace{2.5cm}} $\times 10^{-6}$ T.

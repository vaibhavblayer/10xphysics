\item A series LCR circuit is connected to an AC source of 220V, 50Hz. The circuit contains a resistance \( R = 80\Omega \), an inductor of inductive reactance \( X_L = 70\Omega \), and a capacitor of capacitive reactance \( X_C = 130\Omega \). The power factor of circuit is \( \frac{x}{10} \). The value of \( x \) is : \underline{\hspace{2.5cm}}.

\item When a Si sample is doped with Boron, it becomes P type and when doped by Arsenic it becomes N – type semi conductor such that P-type has excess holes and N-type has excess electrons. When such P – type and N – type semi-conductors, are fused to make a junction, a current will automatically flow which can be detected with an externally connected ammeter.

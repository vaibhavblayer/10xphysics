\item A spherical drop of liquid splits into 1000 identical spherical drops. If $u_i$ is the surface energy of the original drop and $u_f$ is the total surface energy of the resulting drops, the (ignoring evaporation), $\frac{u_f}{u_i} = \left(\frac{10}{x} \right)$. Then value of $x$ is \underline{\hspace{2.5cm}}.

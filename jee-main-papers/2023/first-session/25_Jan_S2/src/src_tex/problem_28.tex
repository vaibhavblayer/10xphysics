\item A capacitor has capacitance 5$\mu$F when its parallel plates are separated by air medium of thickness $d$. A slab of material of dielectric constant 1.5 having area equal to that of plates but thickness $\frac{d}{2}$ is inserted between the plates. Capacitance of the capacitor in the presence of slab will be \underline{\hspace{2.5cm}}$\mu$F.

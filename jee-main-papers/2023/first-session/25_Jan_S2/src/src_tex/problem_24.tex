\item Two cells are connected between points A and B as shown. Cell 1 has emf of 12 V and internal resistance of 3$\Omega$. Cell 2 has emf of 6V and internal resistance of 6$\Omega$. An external resistor R of 4$\Omega$ is connected across A and B. The current flowing through R will be \underline{\hspace{2.5cm}} A.

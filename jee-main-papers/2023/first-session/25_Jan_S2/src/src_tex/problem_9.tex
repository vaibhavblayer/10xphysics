\item A point charge of \(10 \mu C\) is placed at the origin. At what location on the X-axis should a point charge of \(40 \mu C\) be placed so that the net electric field is zero at \(x = 2 \text{ cm}\) on the X-axis?
    \begin{tasks}(2)
        \task \( x = -4 \text{ cm} \)
        \task \( x = 6 \text{ cm} \)
        \task \( x = 4 \text{ cm} \)
        \task \( x = 8 \text{ cm} \)

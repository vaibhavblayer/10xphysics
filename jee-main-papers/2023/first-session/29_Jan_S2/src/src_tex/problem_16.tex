\item The electric field and magnetic field components of an electromagnetic wave going through vacuum is described by
    \[
    E_x = E_0 \sin(kz - \omega t)
    \]
    \[
    B_y = B_0 \sin(kz - \omega t)
    \]
    Then the correct relation \( E_0 \) and \( B_0 \) is given by:
    \begin{tasks}(2)
        \task \( E_0 B_0 = \omega k \)
        \task \( \omega E_0 = k B_0 \)
        \task \( E_0 = k B_0 \)
        \task \( k E_0 = \omega B_0 \)
    \end{tasks}

\item With the help of potentiometer, we can determine the value of emf of a given cell. The sensitivity of the potentiometer is
    \begin{tasks}(1)
        \task Directly proportional to the length of the potentiometer wire
        \task Directly proportional to the potential gradient of the wire
        \task Inversely proportional to the potential gradient of the wire
        \task Inversely proportion to the length of the potentiometer wire
    \end{tasks}
    Choose the correct option for the above statements:
    \begin{tasks}(2)
        \task A only
        \task B and D only
        \task C only
        \task A and C only
    \end{tasks}

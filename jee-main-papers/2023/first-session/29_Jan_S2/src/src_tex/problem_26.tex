\item A metal block of base area 0.20 m\(^2\) is placed on a table as shown in figure. A liquid film of thickness 0.25 mm is inserted between the block and the table. The block is pushed by a horizontal force of 0.1 N and moves with a constant speed. If the viscosity of the liquid is \(5.0 \times 10^{-3}\) Pl, the speed of block is \underline{\hspace{2.5cm}} \(\times 10^{-3}\) m/s.

\item A body of mass 1kg begins to move under the action of a time dependent force  $\vec{F} = \left( t\hat{i} +3t^{2}\hat{j} \right) N$, where $\hat{i}$ and $\hat{j}$ are the unit vectors along x and y axis. The power developed by above force, at the time $t = 2s$, will be \underline{\hspace{2.5cm}} W.

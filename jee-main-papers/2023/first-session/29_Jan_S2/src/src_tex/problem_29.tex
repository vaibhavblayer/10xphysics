\item In an experiment of measuring the refractive index of a glass slab using traveling microscope in physics lab, a student measures real thickness of the glass slab as 5.25 mm and apparent thickness of the glass slab as 5.00 mm. Travelling microscope has 20 divisions in one cm on main scale and 50 divisions on vernier scale is equal to 49 divisions on main scale. The estimate uncertainly in the measurement of refractive index of the slab is $\frac{x}{10} \times 10^{-3}$, where x is \underline{\hspace{2.5cm}}.

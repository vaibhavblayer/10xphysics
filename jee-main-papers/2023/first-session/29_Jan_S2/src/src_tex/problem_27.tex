\item When two resistance \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \) connected in series and introduced into the left gap of a meter bridge and a resistance of \( 10\Omega \) is introduced into the right gap, a null point is found at 60cm from left side. When \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \) are connected in parallel and introduced into the left gap, a resistance of \( 3\Omega \) is introduced into the right-gap to get null point at 40cm from left end. The product of \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \) is \underline{\hspace{2.5cm}} \(\Omega^2\).

\item A car is moving on a circular path of radius 600m such that the magnitude of the tangential acceleration and centripetal acceleration are equal. The time taken by the car to complete first quarter of revolution, if it is moving with an initial speed of 54 km/hr is $t \left(1 - e^{-\pi/2}\right)$ s. The value of t is \underline{\hspace{2.5cm}}.

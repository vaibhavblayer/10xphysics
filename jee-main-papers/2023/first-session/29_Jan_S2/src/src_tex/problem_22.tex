\item An inductor of inductance, $2\mu H$ is connected in series with a resistance, a variable capacitor and an AC source of frequency $7kHz$. The value of capacitance for which maximum current is drawn into the circuit is $\frac{1}{x}$ F, where the value of x is \underline{\hspace{2.5cm}}.
    
    (Take $\pi = \frac{22}{7}$)

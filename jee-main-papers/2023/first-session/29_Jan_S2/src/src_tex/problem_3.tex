\item A fully loaded boeing aircraft has a mass of \(5.4 \times 10^5\) kg. Its total wing area is \(500 \textrm{m}^2\). It is in level flight with a speed of \(1080\textrm{km/h}\). If the density of air \(\rho\) is \(1.2 \textrm{kg m}^{-3}\), the fractional increase in the speed of the air on the upper surface of the wing relative to the lower surface in percentage will be. (\(g = 10 \textrm{m/s}^2\))

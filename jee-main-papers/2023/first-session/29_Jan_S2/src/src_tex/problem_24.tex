\item Unpolarised light is incident on the boundary between two dielectric media, whose dielectric constants are 2.8 (medium - 1) and 6.8 (medium - 2), respectively. To satisfy the condition, so that the reflected and refracted rays are perpendicular to each other, the angle of incidence should be 
\(\tan^{-1} \left(1 + \frac{10}{\theta}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\)
the value of \(\theta\) is \underline{\hspace{2.5cm}}.

    (Given for dielectric media, \(\mu_r = 1\))

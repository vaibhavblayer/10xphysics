\item For a charged spherical ball, electrostatic potential inside the ball varies with \( r \) as \( V = 2ar^2 + b \). Here, \( a \) and \( b \) are constant and \( r \) is the distance from the centre. The volume charge density inside the ball is \(-\lambda a \epsilon\). The value of \(\lambda \) is \underline{\hspace{2.5cm}}.   

\(\epsilon = \) permittivity of the medium.

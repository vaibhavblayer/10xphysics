\item The equation of a circle is given by \( x^2 + y^2 = a^2 \), where \( a \) is the radius. If the equation is modified to change the origin other than \( (0,0) \), then find out the correct dimensions of \( A \) and \( B \) in a new equation:
\[
(x - At)^2 + \left( y - \frac{t}{B} \right)^2 = a^2
\]
The dimensions of \( t \) given as \( [T^{-1}] \).

    \task \( A = [L^{-1}T^{-1}], B = [L^{-1}] \)
    \task \( A = [L^{-1}T^{-1}], B = [LT^{-1}] \)
    \task \( A = [LT], B = [L^{-1}T^{-1}] \)
    \task \( A = [L^{-1}T^{-1}], B = [LT] \)

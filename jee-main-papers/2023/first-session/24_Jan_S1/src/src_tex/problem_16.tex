\item From the photoelectric effect experiment, following observations are made. Identify which of these are correct.
    \begin{tasks}(1)
        \task The stopping potential depends only on the work function of the metal.
        \task The saturation current increases as the intensity of incident light increases.
        \task The maximum kinetic energy of a photo electron depends on the intensity of the incident light.
        \task Photoelectric effect can be explained using wave theory of light.
    \end{tasks}

\item A conducting circular loop of radius $\frac{10}{\sqrt{\pi}}$ cm is placed perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field of 0.5 T. The magnetic field is decreased to zero in 0.5 s at a steady rate. The induced emf in the circular loop at 0.25s is:
    \begin{tasks}(2)
        \task emf = 1 mV
        \task emf = 10 mV
        \task emf = 100 mV
        \task emf = 5 mV
    \end{tasks}

\item A hollow cylindrical conductor has length of 3.14 m, while its inner and outer diameters are 4 mm and 8 mm respectively. The resistance of the conductor is \( n \times 10^{-3} \Omega \). If the resistivity of the material is \( 2.4 \times 10^{-8} \Omega \text{m} \). The value of n is \underline{\hspace{2.5cm}}.

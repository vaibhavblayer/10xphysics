\item A stream of positively charged particles having $\frac{q}{m} = 2 \times 10^{11} \frac{C}{kg}$ and velocity $\vec{v_0} = 3 \times 10^7 \hat{i} \ m / s$ is deflected by an electric field $1.8 \hat{j} \ kV / m$. The electric field exists in a region of 10 cm along x direction. Due to the electric field, the deflection of the charge particles in the y direction is \underline{\hspace{2.5cm}} mm.

\item Given below are two statements: one is labelled as \\
\textbf{Assertion A} and the other is labelled as \textbf{Reason R}
\begin{description}
    \item[Assertion A:] Photodiodes are preferably operated in reverse bias condition for light intensity measurement.
    \item[Reason R:] The current in the forward bias is more than the current in the reverse bias for a p-n junction diode.
\end{description}
In light of the above statements, choose the correct answer from the options given below:

\begin{tasks}(1)
    \task A is false but R is true
    \task A is true but R is false
    \task Both A and R are true but R is not the correct explanation of A
    \task Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation of A
\end{tasks}

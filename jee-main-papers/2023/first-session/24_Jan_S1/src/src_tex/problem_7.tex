\item Given below are two statements:\\
\textbf{Statement I}: If the Brewster's angle for the light propagation from air to glass is $\theta_B$ , then the Brewster's angle for the light propagating from glass to air is $\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta_B$

\textbf{Statement II}: The Brewster's angle for the light propagating from glass to air is $\tan^{-1}(\mu_g)$ where $\mu_g$ is the refractive index of glass.

In the light of the above statements, choose the correct answer from the options given below:
\begin{tasks}(1)
    \task Statement I is false but Statement II is true
    \task Both Statements I and Statement II are false
    \task Both Statement I and Statement II are true
    \task Statement I is true but Statement II is false
\end{tasks}

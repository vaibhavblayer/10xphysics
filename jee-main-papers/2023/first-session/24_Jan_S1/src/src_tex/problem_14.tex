\item Two long straight wires P and Q carrying equal current 10A each were kept parallel to each other at 5cm distance. Magnitude of magnetic force experienced by 10cm length of wire P is \(F_1\). If distance between wires is halved and currents on them are doubled, force \(F_2\) on 10cm length of wire P will be:
    \begin{tasks}(2)
        \task \(\frac{F_1}{10}\)
        \task \(\frac{F_1}{8}\)
        \task \(10F_1\)
        \task \(8F_1\)

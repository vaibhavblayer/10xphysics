\item A block of a mass 2kg is attached with two identical springs of spring constant 20N/m each. The block is placed on a frictionless surface and the ends of the springs are attached to rigid supports (see figure). When the mass is displaced from its equilibrium position, it executes a simple harmonic motion. The time period of oscillation is \(\frac{\pi}{\sqrt{x}}\) in SI unit. The value of \( x \) is \underline{\hspace{2.5cm}}.

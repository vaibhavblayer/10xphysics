Q. Can you define quantum mechanicsQuantum mechanics is a branch of physics that deals with the behavior of particles at the quantum level, which is the smallest scale of energy levels in the universe. It describes the principles and behaviors of particles such as atoms and subatomic particles in terms of their wave-particle duality, uncertainty, and probabilistic nature. Quantum mechanics has revolutionized our understanding of the fundamental nature of matter and energy and is the foundation of many modern technologies, including computers, lasers, and medical imaging devices.

Q. Explain the nuclear fusion reaction.

Nuclear fusion is a reaction in which two or more atomic nuclei combine to form a single, more massive nucleus. This process releases a tremendous amount of energy, which is what powers the sun and other stars. In a fusion reaction, two light nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus and release energy. This energy is released in the form of gamma rays, neutrons, and other particles. Fusion reactions can occur naturally in stars, or they can be artificially induced in a laboratory.

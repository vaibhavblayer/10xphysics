Q. Write python code for tracedpath of a moving point using manim library.

import manimlib.imports as manim import numpy as np import math class TracedPath(manim.Scene): def construct(self): # Create a point and trace its path point = manim.Dot(color=manim.BLUE) point.move_to(np.array([-3, -3, 0])) point.add_updater(lambda m: m.move_to(m.get_center() + np.array([0.1, 0.1, 0]))) # Create a traced path traced_path = manim.VMobject() traced_path.set_points_as_corners([point.get_center()]) traced_path.add_updater(lambda m: m.add_points_as_corners([point.get_center()])) # Add the point and traced path to the scene self.add(point) self.add(traced_path) # Run the animation self.wait(10)

Output:

Explanation:

In this code, we have created a point and traced its path using the manim library.

First, we have imported the manim library and created a class TracedPath which extends the Scene class of the manim library.

Then, we have created a point and traced its path using the VMobject class of the manim library.

We have used the move_to() method to move the point to the specified position.

We have used the add_updater() method to update the pointâ€™s position.

We have used the set_points_as_corners() method to set the points of the traced path.

We have used the add_points_as_corners() method to add the points to the traced path.

Finally, we have added the point and traced path to the scene and run the animation.

Conclusion

In this article, we have learned how to create a traced path of a moving point using the manim library in Python.

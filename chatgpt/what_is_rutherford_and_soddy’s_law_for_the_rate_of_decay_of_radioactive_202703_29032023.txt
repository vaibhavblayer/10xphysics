Q. What is Rutherford and Soddyâ€™s law for the rate of decay of radioactive ?

Rutherford and Soddy's law states that the rate of decay of a radioactive element is proportional to the number of atoms of the element present at any given time. This means that the rate of decay of a radioactive element is directly proportional to the number of atoms of the element present.

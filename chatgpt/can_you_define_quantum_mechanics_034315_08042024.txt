Q. Can you define quantum mechanicsQuantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that describes the behavior of particles at very small scales, such as atoms and subatomic particles. It is a branch of physics that deals with phenomena that are on the scale of quantum levels, where particles can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties. Quantum mechanics also involves the concept of quantum superposition, where particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously, and the principle of quantum entanglement, where particles can become linked and affect each other's properties even when separated by large distances.

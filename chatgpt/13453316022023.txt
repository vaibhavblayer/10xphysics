Q. Why the acidity of water is greater than ethanol?

The acidity of water is greater than ethanol because water is a stronger acid than ethanol. Water has a stronger tendency to donate protons (H+) than ethanol, and so it is a stronger acid. Ethanol has a pKa of 15.9, while water has a pKa of 15.7. This difference in pKa values reflects the difference in acidity between the two substances.

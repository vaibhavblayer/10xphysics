Q. Explain the nuclear fusion reaction.

Nuclear fusion is a process in which two or more atomic nuclei join together, or “fuse”, to form a single heavier nucleus. During this process, matter is not conserved because some of the mass of the fusing nuclei is converted to energy. This energy is released in the form of gamma rays, which can be used to generate electricity. Fusion reactions are the opposite of fission reactions, which involve splitting an atomic nucleus into two or more smaller nuclei.

Q. What is Comptom shift?

Compton shift is a phenomenon in which the wavelength of a photon is shifted to a longer wavelength after it interacts with an electron. This is due to the transfer of energy from the photon to the electron, resulting in the photon being scattered. The amount of shift depends on the energy of the photon and the angle of scattering.

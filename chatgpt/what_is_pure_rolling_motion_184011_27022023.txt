Q. What is pure rolling motion?

Pure rolling motion is a type of motion in which an object rolls without slipping or skidding. This means that the object's center of mass is moving in a straight line, while the object itself is rotating about its own axis. Examples of pure rolling motion include a wheel rolling down a hill, a ball rolling on a flat surface, and a marble rolling in a bowl.

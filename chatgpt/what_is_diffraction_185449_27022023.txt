Q. What is diffraction?

Diffraction is the bending of waves around an obstacle or through an opening. It is a phenomenon that occurs when a wave encounters an obstacle or opening that is comparable in size to its wavelength. Diffraction is most commonly observed with light and sound waves, but can also occur with any type of wave, including water waves and radio waves.

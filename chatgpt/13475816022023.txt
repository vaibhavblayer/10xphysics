Q. Why the acidity of water is greater than ethanol?

The acidity of water is greater than ethanol because water has a higher concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) than ethanol. The hydrogen ions in water are responsible for its higher acidity. Ethanol, on the other hand, has a lower concentration of hydrogen ions, resulting in its lower acidity.

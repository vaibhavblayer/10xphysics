Q. Why the acidity of water is greater than ethanol?

Water has a higher degree of acidity than ethanol because it contains a higher concentration of hydrogen ions, which are responsible for its acidic properties. The hydrogen ions in water are held together by strong hydrogen bonds, making it more acidic than ethanol, which has weaker intermolecular forces.

Q. Explain Coulombs Law in physics.

Coulomb's Law is a law of physics that states that the force of attraction or repulsion between two electric charges is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. In equation form, this law is expressed as F = k*(q1*q2)/r^2, where F is the force between the two charges, q1 and q2 are the magnitudes of the charges, r is the distance between the charges, and k is a constant.

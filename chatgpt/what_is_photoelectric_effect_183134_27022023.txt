Q. What is photoelectric effect ?

The photoelectric effect is a phenomenon in which electrons are emitted from a material when it is exposed to light. This effect is used in a variety of applications, such as solar cells, photodetectors, and photocopiers. When light of a certain frequency is incident on a material, electrons are emitted from the material. The energy of the emitted electrons is dependent on the frequency of the light, not its intensity. This effect was first observed by Heinrich Hertz in 1887 and was later explained by Albert Einstein in 1905.

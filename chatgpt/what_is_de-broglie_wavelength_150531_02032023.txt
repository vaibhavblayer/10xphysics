Q. What is de-Broglie wavelength?

De Broglie wavelength is the wavelength associated with a particle, such as an electron, and is equal to the Planck constant divided by the particle's momentum. It is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics and is used to describe the wave-like behavior of particles.

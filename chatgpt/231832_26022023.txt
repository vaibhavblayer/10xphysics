Q. What is disproportionation reaction?

Disproportionation is a type of redox reaction in which a single element is both oxidized and reduced. This reaction involves the transfer of electrons from one species to another, resulting in two different oxidation states of the same element. Examples of disproportionation reactions include the reaction of chlorine with water to form hypochlorous acid and hydrochloric acid, and the reaction of hydrogen peroxide to form water and oxygen.

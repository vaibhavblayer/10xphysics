Q. how is it possible to make a pot tree

Making a pot tree is possible with a few simple steps. First, choose a pot that is large enough to accommodate the treeâ€™s roots. Fill the pot with potting soil and make sure it is well-draining. Plant the tree in the pot, making sure to keep the roots covered with soil. Water the tree regularly and fertilize it as needed. Place the pot in a sunny spot and make sure it gets plenty of light. Prune the tree as needed to keep it healthy and in shape.

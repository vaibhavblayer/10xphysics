Q. What is Rutherford and Soddyâ€™s law?

Rutherford and Soddy's law, also known as the law of radioactive displacement, states that when a radioactive element decays, its atoms are displaced by atoms of other elements. This means that the atoms of the original element are replaced by atoms of a different element. This law was proposed by Ernest Rutherford and Frederick Soddy in 1903.

Q. Try to explain click in python

Click is a Python package or library intended for creating command-line interfaces (CLI). It provides functionalities for creating beautifully designed and easy to use CLI applications. With Click, developers can add command-line options or arguments and handle the applicationâ€™s behavior.

Here are key features of Click:

1. Arbitrary nesting of commands.
2. Supports lazy loading of subcommands at runtime.
3. Fully nested command line parsing.
4. Defines parameters with options and arguments (supports types and validation automatically).
5. Supports automatic help page generation.

Here's a simple example of how to use Click:

```python
import click

@click.command()
@click.option('--name', prompt='Your name', help='The person to greet.')
def hello(name):
    click.echo(f'Hello {name}!')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    hello()
```

When you run this program in the command line and input your name when prompted, it will greet you with your name.

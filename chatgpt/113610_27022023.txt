Q. What is quantum realm ?

The quantum realm is a term used to describe the realm of physics that deals with the behavior of matter and energy at the subatomic level. It is the realm of the very small, where the laws of classical physics no longer apply and quantum mechanics takes over. It is a realm of extreme conditions, where particles can exist in multiple states at the same time and can be in two places at once.

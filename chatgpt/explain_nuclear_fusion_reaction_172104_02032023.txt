Q. Explain nuclear fusion reaction.

Nuclear fusion is a reaction in which two or more atomic nuclei collide at a very high speed and join to form a new type of nucleus. This process releases a large amount of energy, which can be used to generate electricity. In a nuclear fusion reaction, two light nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus, releasing energy in the process. This energy is released in the form of gamma rays, neutrons, and other particles. Fusion reactions occur naturally in stars, and can also be artificially induced in a laboratory.

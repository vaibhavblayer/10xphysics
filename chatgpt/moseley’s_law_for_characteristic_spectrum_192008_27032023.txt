Q. Moseleyâ€™s law for characteristic spectrum

Moseley's law is an empirical law formulated by Henry Moseley in 1913, which states that the square of the frequency of the X-ray spectral lines of an element is proportional to the atomic number of the element. This law is used to determine the atomic number of an element from the X-ray spectrum of the element. It is expressed mathematically as:

f^2 = Z^2 \times c

where f is the frequency of the X-ray spectral line, Z is the atomic number of the element, and c is a constant.

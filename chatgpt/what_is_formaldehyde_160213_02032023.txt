Q. What is formaldehyde.

Formaldehyde is a colorless, flammable gas with a strong odor. It is a naturally occurring organic compound, and is commonly used in many industrial and household products, such as adhesives, insulation, plywood, and fabrics. It is also used in the production of fertilizers, dyes, and preservatives. In the environment, formaldehyde is produced by the breakdown of organic matter. It is also a byproduct of combustion from sources such as vehicle exhaust and cigarette smoke. Exposure to formaldehyde can cause irritation to the eyes, nose, and throat, and has been linked to certain types of cancer.

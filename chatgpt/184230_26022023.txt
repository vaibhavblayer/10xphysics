Q. Define integral calculus.

Integral calculus is a branch of mathematics that deals with the calculation of integrals, which are used to determine the area under a curve or the volume of a solid. It is used to solve problems in physics, engineering, economics, and other areas of science and technology. Integral calculus is closely related to differential calculus, which is used to calculate derivatives.

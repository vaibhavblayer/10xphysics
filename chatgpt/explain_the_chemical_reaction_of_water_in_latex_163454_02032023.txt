Q. Explain the chemical reaction of water in latex.

The chemical reaction of water in latex is known as hydrolysis. This reaction occurs when water molecules react with the polymers in the latex, breaking them down into smaller molecules. This reaction causes the latex to become brittle and eventually break down. The hydrolysis reaction is accelerated by exposure to heat, light, and oxygen, which can cause the latex to degrade more quickly.

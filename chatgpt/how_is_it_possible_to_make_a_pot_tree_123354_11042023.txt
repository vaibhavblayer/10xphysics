Q. how is it possible to make a pot tree

Making a pot tree is possible by using a large pot or planter, some soil, and a tree sapling. First, fill the pot with soil and make sure it is packed down firmly. Then, carefully place the sapling in the center of the pot and fill in the remaining space with soil. Water the tree regularly and make sure it gets plenty of sunlight. With proper care, your pot tree should grow and thrive.

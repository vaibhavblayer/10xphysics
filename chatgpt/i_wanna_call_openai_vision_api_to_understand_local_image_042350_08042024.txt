Q. I wanna call openai vision api to understand local image

You can use OpenAI's vision model (like CLIP) to understand images. However, please note that the OpenAI API only accepts a URL directly pointing to the file.

For local images, you first have to upload it to a web server or a cloud-based storage service which can provide a publicly accessible URL for the image. You can use services like AWS S3, Azure Blob storage or Google Cloud storage.

After having your image uploaded and a public URL obtained, you can call the API like so:

## Python

```python
import openai

openai.api_key = 'YOUR_OPEN_AI_KEY'

response = openai.ImageCompletion.create(
  model="davinci",
  image_prompt='YOUR_IMAGE_URL'
)

print(response.choices[0].text)
```

In place of `'YOUR_IMAGE_URL'`, pass the string containing the publicly accessible URL of the image.

## Curl

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_OPEN_AI_KEY" \
    -d '{
  "model": "davinci",
  "image_prompt": "YOUR_IMAGE_URL"
}' https://api.openai.com/v1/completions
```

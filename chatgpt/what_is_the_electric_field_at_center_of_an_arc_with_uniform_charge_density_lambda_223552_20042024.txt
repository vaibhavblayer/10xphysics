Q. What is the electric field at center of an arc with uniform charge density lambda?

The electric field is not simply expressible for an arbitrary arc if only the linear charge density (lambda) and the assumption of uniform charge are provided. 

The value of the electric field at the center of the arc will depend on additional specifics such as the radius of the arc and the angle it subtends.

Assuming the arc is part of a circle and subtends an angle 2θ at the centre, we can write:

E = λ/4πε₀ * (2θ/ sinθ)

Where E is the electric field strength, λ is the charge density per unit length along the arc, ε₀ is the permittivity of free space or vacuum, and θ is half of the angle subtended by the arc at the centre.

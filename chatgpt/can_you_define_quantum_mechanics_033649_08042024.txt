Q. Can you define quantum mechanicsQuantum mechanics is a branch of physics that seeks to understand the behavior of matter and energy at very small scales, such as the atomic and subatomic level. It describes the behavior of particles such as electrons and photons in terms of probabilities and wave functions, rather than the deterministic laws of classical physics. Quantum mechanics has led to many important scientific advances, such as the development of lasers, transistors, and nuclear power.

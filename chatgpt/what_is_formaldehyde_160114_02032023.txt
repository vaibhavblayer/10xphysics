Q. What is formaldehyde.

Formaldehyde is a colorless, flammable, strong-smelling chemical used in building materials and many household products. It is used in pressed-wood products, such as particleboard, plywood, and fiberboard; glues and adhesives; permanent-press fabrics; paper product coatings; and certain insulation materials. It is also used to make other chemicals. Exposure to formaldehyde can cause health effects, such as eye, nose, and throat irritation; coughing; wheezing; skin rashes; and other symptoms.

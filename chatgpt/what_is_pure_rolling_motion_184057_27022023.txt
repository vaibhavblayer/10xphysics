Q. What is pure rolling motion?

Pure rolling motion is a type of motion in which an object rolls without slipping or skidding. This means that the point of contact between the object and the surface it is rolling on does not change. Examples of pure rolling motion include a wheel rolling down a hill, a ball rolling on a flat surface, and a tire rolling on a road.

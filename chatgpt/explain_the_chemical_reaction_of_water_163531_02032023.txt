Q. Explain the chemical reaction of water.

Water is a molecule composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom (H2O). The chemical reaction of water is the breaking of the covalent bonds that hold the atoms together. This reaction is known as hydrolysis and involves the addition of a hydrogen ion (H+) and a hydroxide ion (OH-) to the water molecule. The result is two molecules of hydrogen and one molecule of oxygen (H2 + O). This reaction is reversible, meaning that the hydrogen and oxygen molecules can recombine to form water again.

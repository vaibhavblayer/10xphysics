Q. Why the acidity of water is greater than ethanol?

The acidity of water is greater than ethanol because water is a stronger acid than ethanol. Water is a polar molecule, meaning it has a slight positive charge on one end and a slight negative charge on the other, while ethanol is a non-polar molecule and has no charge. Water can more easily donate a proton (H+) than ethanol, which makes it a stronger acid.

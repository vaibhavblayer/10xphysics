Q. What is dielectric in electrostatics?

In electrostatics, a dielectric is an insulating material that can be polarized by an applied electric field. It is a material that can store electric charge and can be used to reduce the electric field between two charged objects. Dielectrics are used in capacitors, which are used to store electrical energy.

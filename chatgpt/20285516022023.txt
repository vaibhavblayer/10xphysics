Q. What is electromagnetism?

Electromagnetism is a branch of physics that studies the interactions between electric charges and magnetic fields. It is one of the four fundamental forces of nature, along with the strong and weak nuclear forces and gravity. Electromagnetic phenomena are characterized by the exchange of photons, which are particles of light. Examples of electromagnetic phenomena include electricity, magnetism, and light.

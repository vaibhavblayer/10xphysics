Q. Dataclass in python.

Dataclasses are a new feature in Python 3.7 that make it easier to create classes that store data. They are similar to regular classes, but they have some additional features that make them more convenient for data storage. Dataclasses use type hints to define the fields in the class and their types, and they provide a number of useful features such as default values, comparison operators, and more. They also provide a convenient way to create data objects that can be serialized and deserialized.

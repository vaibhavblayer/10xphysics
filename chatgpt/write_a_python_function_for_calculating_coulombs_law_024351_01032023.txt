Q. Write a python function for calculating coulombs law.

def coulombs_law(q1, q2, r):
    '''
    This function calculates the force between two charges q1 and q2 separated by a distance r.
    The force is calculated using Coulomb's law.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    q1 : float
        Charge of the first particle.
    q2 : float
        Charge of the second particle.
    r : float
        Distance between the two particles.
    
    Returns
    -------
    force : float
        Force between the two particles.
    '''
    
    # Coulomb's constant
    k = 8.99e9
    
    # Calculate the force
    force = k * (q1 * q2) / (r**2)
    
    return force

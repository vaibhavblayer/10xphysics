Q. What is disproportiation reaction?

Disproportionation reactions are chemical reactions in which a single reactant is simultaneously oxidized and reduced. This type of reaction involves the transfer of electrons from one species to another, resulting in two different products. Examples of disproportionation reactions include the oxidation of sulfite to sulfate and sulfide, and the oxidation of nitrite to nitrate and nitric oxide.

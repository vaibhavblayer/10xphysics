Q. What is the latest discovery in physics?

One of the most recent discoveries in physics is the detection of gravitational waves, which were first predicted by Albert Einstein in his theory of general relativity. These waves are ripples in the fabric of space-time caused by the movement of massive objects, such as black holes and neutron stars. The first detection of gravitational waves was made in 2015 by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO).

Q. Explain the nuclear fusion reaction.

Nuclear fusion is a reaction in which two or more atomic nuclei collide at a very high speed and join to form a new type of nucleus. This process releases a large amount of energy, which can be used to generate electricity. Fusion reactions occur naturally in stars, where hydrogen atoms are fused together to form helium atoms. In a controlled environment, such as a nuclear reactor, fusion reactions can be used to generate electricity. In this process, two isotopes of hydrogen, deuterium and tritium, are fused together to form a helium atom and a neutron. The energy released in this reaction is used to generate electricity.

Q. What is Kepler's third law?

Kepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. Mathematically, this can be expressed as: T^2 = k*a^3, where T is the orbital period, k is a constant, and a is the semi-major axis.

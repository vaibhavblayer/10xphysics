Q. Faradayâ€™s law

Faraday's law states that the magnitude of the induced electromotive force (EMF) in a closed circuit is equal to the rate of change of the magnetic flux through the circuit. In other words, the EMF is proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic field through the circuit. This law is also known as Faraday's law of induction.

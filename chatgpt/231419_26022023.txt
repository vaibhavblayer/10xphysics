Q. What is disproportionation reaction?

Disproportionation reactions are chemical reactions in which a single element or compound is both oxidized and reduced. This type of reaction involves the transfer of electrons from one species to another, resulting in two different oxidation states of the same element or compound. Examples of disproportionation reactions include the reaction of chlorine gas with water to form hypochlorous acid and hydrochloric acid, and the reaction of hydrogen peroxide with manganese dioxide to form water and oxygen.

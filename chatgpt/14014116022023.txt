Q. Why the acidity of water is greater than ethanol?

The acidity of water is greater than ethanol because water is a stronger acid than ethanol. Water has a higher concentration of hydrogen ions, which gives it a lower pH value and a higher degree of acidity. Ethanol is a weaker acid with a higher pH value and a lower degree of acidity.

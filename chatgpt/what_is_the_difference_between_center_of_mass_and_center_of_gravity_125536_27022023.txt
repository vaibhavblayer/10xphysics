Q. What is the difference between center of mass and center of gravity ?

The center of mass is the average position of all the mass in a system, while the center of gravity is the point at which the gravitational force acts on the system. The center of gravity is usually located within the center of mass, but can be shifted depending on the distribution of mass within the system.

Q. What is the difference between the formal charge and oxidation number?

The formal charge is the charge of an atom in a molecule or ion when the bonding electrons are assumed to be shared equally between the atoms in the bond. The oxidation number is the charge an atom would have if all the bonds to that atom were completely ionic. It is a measure of the degree of oxidation of an atom in a compound.

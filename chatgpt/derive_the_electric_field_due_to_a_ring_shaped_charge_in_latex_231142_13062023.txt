Q. Derive the electric field due to a ring shaped charge in latex.

The electric field due to a ring shaped charge is given by:

\begin{equation}
\vec{E} = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\int_{\text{ring}} \frac{\sigma \hat{r}}{r^2} ds
\end{equation}

where $\sigma$ is the linear charge density of the ring, $\hat{r}$ is the unit vector pointing from the charge to the point of interest, and $r$ is the distance from the charge to the point of interest.

\item A balloon starts rising from the surface of the Earth. The ascension rate is constant and equal to \( v_0 \). Due to the wind the balloon gathers the horizontal velocity component \( v_x = ay \), where \( a \) is a constant and \( y \) is the height of ascent. Find how the following quantities depend on the height of ascent:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item the horizontal drift of the balloon \( x(y) \);
        \item the total, tangential, and normal accelerations of the balloon.
    \end{enumerate}

\item A solid body rotates with a constant angular velocity \(\omega_0 = 0.50\) rad/s about a horizontal axis AB. At the moment \(t = 0\) the axis AB starts turning about the vertical with a constant angular acceleration \(\beta_0 = 0.10\) rad/s\(^2\). Find the angular velocity and angular acceleration of the body after \(t = 3.5\) s.

\item A particle A moves in one direction along a given trajectory with a tangential acceleration \( w_t = at \), where \( a \) is a constant vector coinciding in direction with the \( x \) axis (Fig. 1.4), and \( \tau \) is a unit vector coinciding in direction with the velocity vector at a given point. Find how the velocity of the particle depends on \( x \) provided that its velocity is negligible at the point \( x = 0 \).

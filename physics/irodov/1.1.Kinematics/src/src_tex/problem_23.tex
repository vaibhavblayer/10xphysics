\item A point moves rectilinearly with deceleration whose modulus depends on the velocity \( v \) of the particle as \( w = -a\sqrt{v} \), where \( a \) is a positive constant. At the initial moment the velocity of the point is equal to \( v_0 \). What distance will it traverse before it stops? What time will it take to cover that distance?

\item Point A moves uniformly with velocity \( v \) so that the vector \( v \) is continually "aimed" at point B which in its turn moves rectilinearly and uniformly with velocity \( u < v \). At the initial moment of time \( v \perp u \) and the points are separated by a distance \( l \). How soon will the points converge?

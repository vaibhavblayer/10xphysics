\item A radius vector of a point A relative to the origin varies with time \( t \) as \( \mathbf{r} = at\mathbf{i} - bt^3\mathbf{j} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are positive constants, and \( \mathbf{i} \) and \( \mathbf{j} \) are the unit vectors of the \( x \) and \( y \) axes. Find:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item the equation of the point's trajectory \( y(x) \); plot this function;
        \item the time dependence of the velocity \( \mathbf{v} \) and acceleration \( \mathbf{w} \) vectors, as well as of the moduli of these quantities;
        \item the time dependence of the angle \( \alpha \) between the vectors \( \mathbf{w} \) and \( \mathbf{v} \);
        \item the mean velocity vector averaged over the first \( t \) seconds of motion, and the modulus of this vector.
    \end{enumerate}

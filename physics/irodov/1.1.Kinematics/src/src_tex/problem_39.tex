\item A point moves along an arc of a circle of radius \( R \). Its velocity depends on the distance covered \( s \) as \( v = \alpha\sqrt{s} \), where \( \alpha \) is a constant. Find the angle \( \alpha \) between the vector of the total acceleration and the vector of velocity as a function of \( s \).

\item A shell acquires the initial velocity \(v = 320 \, \text{m/s}\), having made \(n = 2.0\) turns inside the barrel whose length is equal to \(l = 2.0 \, \text{m}\). Assuming that the shell moves inside the barrel with a uniform acceleration, find the angular velocity of its axial rotation at the moment when the shell escapes the barrel.

\item Two particles, 1 and 2, move with constant velocities \(v_1\) and \(v_2\) along two mutually perpendicular straight lines toward the intersection point O. At the moment \(t = 0\) the particles were located at the distances \(l_1\) and \(l_2\) from the point O. How soon will the distance between the particles become the smallest? What is it equal to?

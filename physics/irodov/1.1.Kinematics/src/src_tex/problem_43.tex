\item A particle A moves along a circle of radius \( R = 50 \) cm so that its radius vector \( \mathbf{r} \) relative to the point \( O \) (Fig. 1.5) rotates with the constant angular velocity \( \omega = 0.40 \) rad/s. Find the modulus of the velocity of the particle, and the modulus and direction of its total acceleration.

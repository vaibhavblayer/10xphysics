\item The velocity of a particle moving in the positive direction of the \( x \) axis varies as \( v = \alpha\sqrt{x} \), where \( \alpha \) is a positive constant. Assuming that at the moment \( t = 0 \) the particle was located at the point \( x = 0 \), find:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item the time dependence of the velocity and the acceleration of the particle;
        \item the mean velocity of the particle averaged over the time that the particle takes to cover the first \( s \) metres of the path.
    \end{enumerate}

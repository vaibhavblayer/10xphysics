\item A solid body starts rotating about a stationary axis with an angular acceleration \(\beta = \beta_0 \cos \varphi\), where \(\beta_0\) is a constant vector and \(\varphi\) is an angle of rotation from the initial position. Find the angular velocity of the body as a function of the angle \(\varphi\). Draw the plot of this dependence.

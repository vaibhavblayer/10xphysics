\item A car starts moving rectilinearly, first with acceleration $w = -5.0\ m/s^2$ (the initial velocity is equal to zero), then uniformly, and finally, decelerating at the same rate $w$, comes to a stop. The total time of motion equals $\tau = 25\ s$. The average velocity during that time is equal to $\langle v \rangle = 72\ km$ per hour. How long does the car move uniformly?

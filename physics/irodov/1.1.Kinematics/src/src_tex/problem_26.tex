\item A point moves in the plane $xy$ according to the law $x = a \sin \omega t$, $y = a(1 - \cos \omega t)$, where $a$ and $\omega$ are positive constants. Find:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item the distance $s$ traversed by the point during the time $t$;
        \item the angle between the point's velocity and acceleration vectors.
    \end{enumerate}

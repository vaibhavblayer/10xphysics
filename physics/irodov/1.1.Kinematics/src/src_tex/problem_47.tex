\item A solid body starts rotating about a stationary axis with an angular acceleration $\beta = at$, where $a = 2.0 \cdot 10^{-2} \text{ rad/s}^3$. How soon after the beginning of rotation will the total acceleration vector of an arbitrary point of the body form an angle $\alpha = 60^\circ$ with its velocity vector?

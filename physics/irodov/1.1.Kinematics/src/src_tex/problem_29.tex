\item A body is thrown from the surface of the Earth at an angle $\alpha$ to the horizontal with the initial velocity $v_0$. Assuming the air drag to be negligible, find:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item the time of motion;
        \item the maximum height of ascent and the horizontal range; at what value of the angle $\alpha$ they will be equal to each other;
        \item the equation of trajectory $y(x)$, where $y$ and $x$ are displacements of the body along the vertical and the horizontal respectively;
        \item the curvature radii of trajectory at its initial point and at its peak.
    \end{enumerate}

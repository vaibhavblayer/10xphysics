\item From point \( A \) located on a highway (Fig. 1.2) one has to get by car as soon as possible to point \( B \) located in the field at a distance \( l \) from the highway. It is known that the car moves in the field \( \eta \) times slower than on the highway. At what distance from point \( D \) one must turn off the highway?

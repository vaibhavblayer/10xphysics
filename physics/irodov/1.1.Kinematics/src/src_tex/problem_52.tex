\item A point \( A \) is located on the rim of a wheel of radius \( R = 0.50 \) m which rolls without slipping along a horizontal surface with velocity \( v = 1.00 \) m/s. Find:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item the modulus and the direction of the acceleration vector of the point \( A \);
        \item the total distance \( s \) traversed by the point \( A \) between the two successive moments at which it touches the surface.
    \end{enumerate}

\item At the moment \( t = 0 \) a particle leaves the origin and moves in the positive direction of the \( x \) axis. Its velocity varies with time as \( v = v_0 (1 - t/\tau) \), where \( v_0 \) is the initial velocity vector whose modulus equals \( v_0 = 10.0 \) cm/s; \( \tau = 5.0 \) s. Find:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item the \( x \) coordinate of the particle at the moments of time 6.0, 10, and 20 s;
        \item the moments of time when the particle is at the distance 10.0 cm from the origin;
        \item the distance \( s \) covered by the particle during the first 4.0 and 8.0 s; draw the approximate plot \( s(t) \).
    \end{enumerate}

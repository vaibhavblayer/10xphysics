\item A particle moves along an arc of a circle of radius \( R \) according to the law \( l = a \sin \omega t \), where \( l \) is the displacement from the initial position measured along the arc, and \( a \) and \( \omega \) are constants. Assuming \( R = 1.00 \, m \), \( a = 0.80 \, m \), and \( \omega = 2.00 \, rad/s \), find:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item the magnitude of the total acceleration of the particle at the points \( l = 0 \) and \( l = \pm a \);
        \item the minimum value of the total acceleration \( w_{\text{min}} \) and the corresponding displacement \( l_m \).
    \end{enumerate}

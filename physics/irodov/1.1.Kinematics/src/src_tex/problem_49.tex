\item A solid body rotates about a stationary axis so that its angular velocity depends on the rotation angle $\varphi$ as $\omega = \omega_0 - a\varphi$, where $\omega_0$ and $a$ are positive constants. At the moment $t = 0$ the angle $\varphi = 0$. Find the time dependence of
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item the rotation angle;
        \item the angular velocity.
    \end{enumerate}

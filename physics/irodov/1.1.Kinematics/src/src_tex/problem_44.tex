\item A wheel rotates around a stationary axis so that the rotation angle $\varphi$ varies with time as $\varphi = at^2$, where $a = 0.20 \text{ rad/s}^2$. Find the total acceleration $w$ of the point $A$ at the rim at the moment $t = 2.5 \text{ s}$ if the linear velocity of the point $A$ at this moment $v = 0.65 \text{ m/s}$.

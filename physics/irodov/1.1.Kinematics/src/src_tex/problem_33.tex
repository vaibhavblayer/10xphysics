\item A cannon fires successively two shells with velocity \( v_0 = 250 \ \text{m/s} \); the first at the angle \( \theta_1 = 60^\circ \) and the second at the angle \( \theta_2 = 45^\circ \) to the horizontal, the azimuth being the same. Neglecting the air drag, find the time interval between firings leading to the collision of the shells.

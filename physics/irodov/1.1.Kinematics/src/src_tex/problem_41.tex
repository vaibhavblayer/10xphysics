\item A point moves in the plane so that its tangential acceleration \( w_t = a \), and its normal acceleration \( w_n = bt^4 \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are positive constants, and \( t \) is time. At the moment \( t = 0 \) the point was at rest. Find how the curvature radius \( R \) of the point's trajectory and the total acceleration \( w \) depend on the distance covered \( s \).

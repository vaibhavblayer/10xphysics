\item A round cone with half-angle \( \alpha = 30^\circ \) and the radius of the base \( R = 5.0 \) cm rolls uniformly and without slipping over a horizontal plane as shown in Fig. 1.8. The cone apex is hinged at the point \( O \) which is on the same level with the point \( C \), the cone base centre. The velocity of point \( C \) is \( v = 10.0 \) cm/s. Find the moduli of

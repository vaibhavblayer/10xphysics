\item A point moves in the plane $xy$ according to the law $x = at$, $y = at(1 - \alpha t)$, where $a$ and $\alpha$ are positive constants, and $t$ is time. Find:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item the equation of the pointâ€™s trajectory $y(x)$; plot this function;
    \item the velocity $v$ and the acceleration $w$ of the point as functions of time;
    \item the moment $t_0$ at which the velocity vector forms an angle $\pi/4$ with the acceleration vector.
\end{enumerate}

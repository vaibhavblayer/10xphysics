\item A particle moves in the plane xy with velocity \(\mathbf{v} = a\mathbf{i} + b\mathbf{x}\mathbf{j}\), where \(\mathbf{i}\) and \(\mathbf{j}\) are the unit vectors of the x and y axes, and a and b are constants. At the initial moment of time the particle was located at the point \(x = y = 0\). Find:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item the equation of the particle's trajectory \(y(x)\);
        \item the curvature radius of trajectory as a function of x.
    \end{enumerate}

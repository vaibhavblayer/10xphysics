\item A small body is thrown at an angle to the horizontal with the initial velocity \( v_0 \). Neglecting the air drag, find:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item the displacement of the body as a function of time \( r(t) \);
        \item the mean velocity vector \( \langle v \rangle \) averaged over the first \( t \) seconds and over the total time of motion.
    \end{enumerate}

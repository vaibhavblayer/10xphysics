\item A particle moves along the plane trajectory \(y(x)\) with velocity \(v\) whose modulus is constant. Find the acceleration of the particle at the point \(x = 0\) and the curvature radius of the trajectory at that point if the trajectory has the form
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item of a parabola \(y = ax^2\).
        \item of an ellipse \(\left(\frac{x}{a}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y}{b}\right)^2 = 1\); \(a\) and \(b\) are constants here.
    \end{enumerate}

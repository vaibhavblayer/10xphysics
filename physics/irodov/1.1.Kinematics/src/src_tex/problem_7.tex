\item Two swimmers leave point \( A \) on one bank of the river to reach point \( B \) lying right across on the other bank. One of them crosses the river along the straight line \( AB \) while the other swims at right angles to the stream and then walks the distance that he has been carried away by the stream to get to point \( B \). What was the velocity \( u \) of his walking if both swimmers reached the destination simultaneously? The stream velocity \( v_0 = 2.0 \) km/hour and the velocity \( v' \) of each swimmer with respect to water equals \( 2.5 \) km per hour.

        \begin{tikzpicture}

    \begin{align*}
        \intertext{Let us suppose one of the swimmers (say 1) crosses the river along \(AB\), which is obviously the shortest path. Time taken to cross the river by the swimmer 1}
        t_1 &= \dfrac{d}{\sqrt{v'^2 - v_0^2}} \quad \text{(where \(AB = d\) is the width of the river)} \tag{1}\\
        \intertext{For the other swimmer (say 2), who follows the quickest path, the time taken to cross the river,}
        t_2 &= \dfrac{d}{v'} \tag{2}\\
        \intertext{In the time \(t_2\), drifting of the swimmer 2, becomes}
        x &= v_0 t_2 = \dfrac{v_0}{v'}d \quad \text{(using Eq. 2)} \tag{3}\\
        \intertext{If \(t_3\) be the time for swimmer 2 to walk the distance \(x\) to come \(C\) to \(B\) (see figure), then}
        t_3 &= \dfrac{x}{u} = \dfrac{v_0 d}{v' u} \quad \text{(using Eq. 3)} \tag{4}\\
        \intertext{According to the problem \(t_1 = t_2 + t_3\)}
        \dfrac{d}{\sqrt{v'^2 - v_0^2}} &= \dfrac{d}{v'} + \dfrac{v_0 d}{v' u}\\
        \Rightarrow \quad \dfrac{v_0}{u} &= \dfrac{v'}{\sqrt{v'^2 - v_0^2}} - 1\\
        \intertext{Thus,}
        u &= \dfrac{v_0}{\left(1 - \dfrac{v_0^2}{v'^2}\right)^{-1/2} - 1} = 3 \, \text{km/h}
    \end{align*}

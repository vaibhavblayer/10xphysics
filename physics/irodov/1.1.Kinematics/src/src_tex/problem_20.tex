\item A radius vector of a particle varies with time $t$ as $\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{a}t (1 - \alpha t)$, where $\mathbf{a}$ is a constant vector and $\alpha$ is a positive factor.
Find:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item the velocity $v$ and the acceleration $w$ of the particle as functions of time;
    \item the time interval $\Delta t$ taken by the particle to return to the initial points, and the distance $s$ covered during that time.
\end{enumerate}

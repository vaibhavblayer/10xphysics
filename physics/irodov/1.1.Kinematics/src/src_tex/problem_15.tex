\item An elevator car whose floor-to-ceiling distance is equal to 2.7 m starts ascending with constant acceleration \(1.2 \, \text{m/s}^2\), \(2.0 \, \text{s}\) after the start a bolt begins falling from the ceiling of the car. Find:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item the bolt's free fall time;
        \item the displacement and the distance covered by the bolt during the free fall in the reference frame fixed to the elevator shaft.
    \end{enumerate}

    \begin{align*}
        \intertext{(a) As time interval between two events is reference independent in Newtonian mechanics, so it is better to solve the problem in the elevator's frame having the observer at its floor (see figure). Let us denote separation between floor and ceiling by $h = 2.7 \text{ m}$ and the acceleration of the elevator by $w = 1.2 \text{ m/s}^2$.}
        \intertext{From the kinematical formula}
        y &= y_0 + v_{0y} t + \frac{1}{2} w_y t^2 \\
        \intertext{Here,}
        y &= 0, \quad y_0 = h, \quad v_{0y} = 0 \\
        \intertext{and}
        w_y &= w_{\text{bolt}(y)} - w_{\text{ele}(y)} \\
             &= - (g) - (- w) = -(g + w) \\
        \intertext{So,}
        0 &= h + \frac{1}{2} [-(g + w)] t^2 \\
        \intertext{or}
        t &= \sqrt{\dfrac{2h}{g + w}} = 0.7 \text{ s} \quad \text{(on substituting values)}
    \end{align*}
    
    \begin{align*}
        \intertext{(b) At the moment the bolt loses contact with the elevator, it has already acquired the velocity equal to elevator, given by;}
        v_0 &= (1.2) (2) = 2.4 \text{ m/s}
        \intertext{In the reference frame attached with the elevator shaft (ground) and pointing the $y$-axis upward, we have for the displacement of the bolt,}
        \Delta y &= v_{0y} t + \frac{1}{2} w_y t^2 \\
                 &= v_0 t + \frac{1}{2} (-g) t^2 \\
        \intertext{or}
        \Delta y &= (2.4)(0.7) + \frac{1}{2} (-9.8)(0.7)^2 \\
                 &= - 0.7 \text{ m}
        \intertext{Hence the bolt comes down or displaces downward relative to the point, when it loses contact with the elevator by the amount 0.7 m (see figure). Obviously the total distance covered by the bolt during its free fall time}
        s &= |\Delta y| + 2 \left(\frac{v_0^2}{2g} \right) = 0.7 \text{ m} + \left(\frac{(2.4)^2}{9.8} \right) \text{ m} = 1.3 \text{ m}
    \end{align*}

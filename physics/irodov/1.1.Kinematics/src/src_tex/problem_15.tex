\item An elevator car whose floor-to-ceiling distance is equal to 2.7 m starts ascending with constant acceleration \(1.2 \, \text{m/s}^2\), \(2.0 \, \text{s}\) after the start a bolt begins falling from the ceiling of the car. Find:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item the bolt's free fall time;
        \item the displacement and the distance covered by the bolt during the free fall in the reference frame fixed to the elevator shaft.
    \end{enumerate}

\item Two boats, A and B, move away from a buoy anchored at the middle of a river along the mutually perpendicular straight lines: the boat A along the river, and the boat B across the river. Having moved off an equal distance from the buoy the boats returned. Find the ratio of times of motion of boats $\tau_A / \tau_B$ if the velocity of each boat with respect to water is $\eta = 1.2$ times greater than the stream velocity.

\item A ship moves along the equator to the east with velocity \( v_0 = 30 \) km/hour. The southeastern wind blows at an angle \( \varphi = 60^\circ \) to the equator with velocity \( v = 15 \) km/hour. Find the wind velocity \( v' \) relative to the ship and the angle \( \varphi' \) between the equator and the wind direction in the reference frame fixed to the ship.

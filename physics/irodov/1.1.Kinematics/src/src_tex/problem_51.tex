\item A rotating disc (Fig. 1.6) moves in the positive direction of the x axis. Find the equation \( y(x) \) describing the position of the instantaneous axis of rotation, if at the initial moment the axis \( C \) of the disc was located at the point \( O \) after which it moved
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item with a constant velocity \( v \), while the disc started rotating counterclockwise with a constant angular acceleration \( \beta \) (the initial angular velocity is equal to zero);
    
        \item with a constant acceleration \( w \) (and the zero initial velocity), while the disc rotates counterclockwise with a constant angular velocity \( \omega \).
    \end{enumerate}

\item Two touching bars 1 and 2 are placed on an inclined plane forming an angle \(\alpha\) with the horizontal (Fig. 1.10). The masses of the bars are equal to \(m_1\) and \(m_2\), and the coefficients of friction between the inclined plane and these bars are equal to \(k_1\) and \(k_2\) respectively, with \(k_1 > k_2\). Find:

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item the force of interaction of the bars in the process of motion;
        \item the minimum value of the angle \(\alpha\) at which the bars start sliding down.
    \end{enumerate}

\item A particle moves in a plane under the action of a force which is always perpendicular to the particle's velocity and depends on a distance to a certain point on the plane as \( 1/r^n \), where \( n \) is a constant. At what value of \( n \) will the motion of the particle along the circle be \textit{steady}?

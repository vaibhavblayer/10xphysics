\item At the moment \( t = 0 \) the force \( F = at \) is applied to a small body of mass \( m \) resting on a smooth horizontal plane (\( a \) is a constant).

    The permanent direction of this force forms an angle \( \alpha \) with the horizontal (Fig. 1.14). Find:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item the velocity of the body at the moment of its breaking off the plane;
        \item the distance traversed by the body up to this moment.
    \end{enumerate}

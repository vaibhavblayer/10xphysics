\item A fixed pulley carries a weightless thread with masses $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$ at its ends. There is friction between the thread and the pulley. It is such that the thread starts slipping when the ratio $m_{2}/m_{1} = \eta_{0}$. Find:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item the friction coefficient;
        \item the acceleration of the masses when $m_{2}/m_{1} = \eta > \eta_{0}$.
    \end{enumerate}

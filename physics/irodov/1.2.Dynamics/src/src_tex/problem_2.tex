\item In the arrangement of Fig. 1.9 the masses \( m_0 \), \( m_1 \), and \( m_2 \) of bodies are equal, the masses of the pulley and the threads are negligible, and there is no friction in the pulley. Find the acceleration \( w \) with which the body \( m_0 \) comes down, and the tension of the thread binding together the bodies \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \), if the coefficient of friction between these bodies and the horizontal surface is equal to \( k \). Consider possible cases.

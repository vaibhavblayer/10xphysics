\item A body of mass \( m \) rests on a horizontal plane with the friction coefficient \( k \). At the moment \( t = 0 \) a horizontal force is applied to it, which varies with time as \( \mathbf{F} = at \), where \( a \) is a constant vector.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Find the distance traversed by the body during the first \( t \) seconds after the force action began.
    \end{enumerate}

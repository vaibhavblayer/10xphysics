\item A plank of mass $m_1$ with a bar of mass $m_2$ placed on it lies on a smooth horizontal plane. A horizontal force growing with time $t$ as $F = at$ ($a$ is constant) is applied to the bar. Find how the accelerations of the plank $w_1$ and of the bar $w_2$ depend on $t$, if the coefficient of friction between the plank and the bar is equal to $k$. Draw the approximate plots of these dependences.

\item At the moment \( t = 0 \) a stationary particle of mass \( m \) experiences a time-dependent force \( \mathbf{F} = a t (\tau - t) \), where \( a \) is a constant vector, \( \tau \) is the time during which the given force acts. Find:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item the momentum of the particle when the action of the force is discontinued;
        \item the distance covered by the particle while the force acted.
    \end{enumerate}

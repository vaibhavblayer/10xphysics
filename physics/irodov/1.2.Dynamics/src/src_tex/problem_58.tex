\item A train of mass \( m = 2000 \) tons moves in the latitude \( \varphi = 60^\circ \) North. Find:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item the magnitude and direction of the lateral force that the train exerts on the rails if it moves along a meridian with a velocity \( v = 54 \) km per hour;
        \item in what direction and with what velocity the train should move for the resultant of the inertial forces acting on the train in the reference frame fixed to the Earth to be equal to zero.
    \end{enumerate}

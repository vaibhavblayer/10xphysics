\item A horizontal disc of radius \( R \) rotates with a constant angular velocity \( \omega \) about a stationary vertical axis passing through its edge. Along the circumference of the disc a particle of mass \( m \) moves with a velocity that is constant relative to the disc. At the moment when the particle is at the maximum distance from the rotation axis, the resultant of the inertial forces \( F_{in} \) acting on the particle in the reference frame fixed to the disc turns into zero. Find:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item the acceleration \( w' \) of the particle relative to the disc;
        \item the dependence of \( F_{in} \) on the distance from the rotation axis.
    \end{enumerate}

\item A ball suspended by a thread swings in a vertical plane so that its acceleration values in the extreme and the lowest position are equal. Find the thread deflection angle in the extreme position.
\begin{solution}
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \pic at (0, 0) {frame=3cm};
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    
    \begin{align*}
        \intertext{1.86 The ball has only normal acceleration at the lowest position and only tangential acceleration at either of the extreme positions, Let \( v \) be the speed of the ball at its lowest position and \( l \) be length of the thread, then according to the problem}
        \dfrac{v^2}{l} &= g \sin \alpha \tag{1} 
        \intertext{where \(\alpha\) is the maximum deflection angle.}
        \intertext{From Newtonâ€™s law in projection form: }
        F_t &= m v_t\\
        -mg \sin \theta &= m v \dfrac{dv}{l d\theta}\\
        -gl \sin \theta d\theta &= v dv
        \intertext{On integrating both the sides within their limits.}
        - gl \int_0^\alpha \sin \theta d\theta &= \int_v^0 v dv\\
        \intertext{or\quad \quad \quad \quad \( v^2 = 2gl (1 - \cos \alpha)\) \tag{2}}
        \intertext{Note: Eq. (2) can easily be obtained by the conservation of mechanical energy of the ball in the uniform field of gravity.}
        \intertext{From Eqs. (1) and (2) with \(\theta = \alpha\)}
        \sin \alpha &= 2 (1 - \cos \alpha)\\
        \sin \alpha + 2 \cos \alpha &= 2
        \intertext{On solving we get,}
        \alpha &\approx 53^\circ
    \end{align*}

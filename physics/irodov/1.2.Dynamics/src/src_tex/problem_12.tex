\item A horizontal plane with the coefficient of friction \( k \) supports two bodies: a bar and an electric motor with a battery on a block. A thread attached to the bar is wound on the shaft of the electric motor. The distance between the bar and the electric motor is equal to \( l \). When the motor is switched on, the bar, whose mass is twice as great as that of the other body, starts moving with a constant acceleration \( w \). How soon will the bodies collide?

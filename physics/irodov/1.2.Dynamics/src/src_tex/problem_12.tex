\item A horizontal plane with the coefficient of friction \( k \) supports two bodies: a bar and an electric motor with a battery on a block. A thread attached to the bar is wound on the shaft of the electric motor. The distance between the bar and the electric motor is equal to \( l \). When the motor is switched on, the bar, whose mass is twice as great as that of the other body, starts moving with a constant acceleration \( w \). How soon will the bodies collide?\begin{solution}
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \pic at (0, 0) {frame=3cm};
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    
    \begin{align*}
        \intertext{From the Newtonâ€™s second law in projection form}
        \text{For the bar,} \quad T - 2 \ k \ m \ g &= (2m) \ w \tag{1}\\
        \text{For the motor,} \quad T - kmg &= mw' \tag{2}\\
        \intertext{Now, from the equation of kinematics in the frame of bar or motor}
        l &= \frac{1}{2} (w + w') \ t^2 \tag{3}\\
        \intertext{From Eqs. (1), (2) and (3) we get on eliminating $T$ and $w'$}
        t &= \sqrt{\frac{2l}{kg + 3w}}
    \end{align*}
\end{solution}

\item A pulley fixed to the ceiling of an elevator car carries a thread whose ends are attached to the loads of masses $m_1$ and $m_2$. The car starts going up with an acceleration $w_0$. Assuming the masses of the pulley and the thread, as well as the friction, to be negligible find:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item the acceleration of the load $m_1$ relative to the elevator shaft and relative to the car;
        \item the force exerted by the pulley on the ceiling of the car.

        \intertext{Let us write Newton's second law in vector form \( \vec{F} = m \vec{w} \), for both the blocks (in the frame of ground)}
        T + m_1 g &= m_1 \vec{w}_1 \tag{1} \\
        T + m_2 g &= m_2 \vec{w}_2 \tag{2} 
        \intertext{These two equations contain three unknown quantities \( \vec{w}_1 \), \( \vec{w}_2 \) and \( T \). The third equation is provided by the kinematic relationship between the accelerations}

        \intertext{where \( \vec{w} \) is the acceleration of the mass \( m_1 \) with respect to the pulley or elevator car.}
        \intertext{Summing up term wise the left hand and the right-hand sides of these kinematical equations, we get}
        \vec{w}_1 + \vec{w}_2 &= 2 \vec{w}_0 \tag{4}

\item A pulley fixed to the ceiling of an elevator car carries a thread whose ends are attached to the loads of masses $m_1$ and $m_2$. The car starts going up with an acceleration $w_0$. Assuming the masses of the pulley and the thread, as well as the friction, to be negligible find:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item the acceleration of the load $m_1$ relative to the elevator shaft and relative to the car;
        \item the force exerted by the pulley on the ceiling of the car.
    \end{enumerate}

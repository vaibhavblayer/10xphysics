\item A device (Fig. 1.26) consists of a smooth L-shaped rod located in a horizontal plane and a sleeve \( A \) of mass \( m \) attached by a weightless spring to a point \( B \). The spring stiffness is equal to \( \kappa \). The whole system rotates with a constant angular velocity \( \omega \) about a vertical axis passing through the point \( O \). Find the elongation of the spring. How is the result affected by the rotation direction?

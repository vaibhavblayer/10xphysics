\item In the arrangement shown in Fig.\ 1.21 the masses of the wedge $M$ and the body $m$ are known. The appreciable friction exists

    only between the wedge and the body $m$, the friction coefficient being equal to $k$. The masses of the pulley and the thread are negligible. Find the acceleration of the body $m$ relative to the horizontal surface on which the wedge slides.

\item What is the minimum acceleration with which bar \( A \) (Fig. 1.22) should be shifted horizontally to keep bodies \( 1 \) and \( 2 \) stationary relative to the bar? The masses of the bodies are equal, and the coefficient of friction between the bar and the bodies is equal to \( k \). The masses of the pulley and the threads are negligible, the friction in the pulley is absent.

    %     \intertext{Bodies 1 and 2 will remain at rest with respect to bar 4 for $w_{\min} \le w \le w_{\max}$ where $w_{\min}$ is the sought minimum acceleration of the bar. Beyond these limits there will be a relative motion between bar and the bodies. For $0 \le w \le w_{\min}$ the tendency of body 1 in relation to the bar A is to move towards right and is in the opposite sense for $w \ge w_{\max}$. On the basis of above argument the static friction on 2 by A is directed upward and on 1 by A is directed towards left for the purpose of calculating $w_{\min}$.}

    %     \intertext{As body 2 has no acceleration in vertical direction, so}
    %     N_2 &= mw \tag{2}

\item A small body is placed on the top of a smooth sphere of radius $R$. Then the sphere is imparted a constant acceleration $w_0$ in the horizontal direction and the body begins sliding down. Find:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item the velocity of the body relative to the sphere at the moment of break-off;
        \item the angle $\theta_0$ between the vertical and the radius vector drawn from the centre of the sphere to the break-off point; calculate $\theta_0$ for $w_0 = g$.
    \end{enumerate}

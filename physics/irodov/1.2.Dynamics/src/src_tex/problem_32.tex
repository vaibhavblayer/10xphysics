\item A car moves with a constant tangential acceleration \( w_\tau = 0.62 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) along a horizontal surface circumscribing a circle of radius \( R = 40 \, \text{m} \). The coefficient of sliding friction between the wheels of the car and the surface is \( k = 0.20 \). What distance will the car ride without sliding if at the initial moment of time its velocity is equal to zero?

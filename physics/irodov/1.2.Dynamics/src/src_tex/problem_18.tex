\item In the arrangement shown in Fig. 1.49 the mass of body 1 is $\eta=4.0$ times as great as that of body 2. The height $h=20 \text{ cm}$. The masses of the pulleys and the threads, as well as the friction, are negligible. At a certain moment body 2 is released and the arrangement set in motion. What is the maximum height that body 2 will go up to?

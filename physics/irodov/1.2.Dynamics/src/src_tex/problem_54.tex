\item A horizontal disc rotates with a constant angular velocity \(\omega = 6.0 \, \text{rad/s}\) about a vertical axis passing through its centre. A small body of mass \(m = 0.50 \, \text{kg}\) moves along a diameter of the disc with a velocity \(v' = 50 \, \text{cm/s}\) which is constant relative to the disc. Find the force that the disc exerts on the body at the moment when it is located at the distance \(r = 30 \, \text{cm}\) from the rotation axis.

\item A rifle was aimed at the vertical line on the target located precisely in the northern direction, and then fired. Assuming the air drag to be negligible, find how much off the line, and in what direction, will the bullet hit the target. The shot was fired in the horizontal direction at the latitude $\varphi = 60^\circ$, the bullet velocity $v = 900$ m/s, and the distance from the target equals $s = 1.0$ km.

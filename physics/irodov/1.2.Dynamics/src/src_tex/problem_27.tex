\item A small sphere of mass $m$ suspended by a thread is first taken aside so that the thread forms the right angle with the vertical and then released. Find:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item the total acceleration of the sphere and the thread tension as a function of $\theta$, the angle of deflection of the thread from the vertical;
        \item the thread tension at the moment when the vertical component of the sphere's velocity is maximum;
        \item the angle $\theta$ between the thread and the vertical at the moment when the total acceleration vector of the sphere is directed horizontally.
    \end{enumerate}

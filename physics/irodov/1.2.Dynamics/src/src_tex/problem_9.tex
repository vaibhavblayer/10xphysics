\item A bar of mass \( m \) is pulled by means of a thread up an inclined plane forming an angle \( \alpha \) with the horizontal (Fig. 1.13). The coefficient of friction is equal to \( k \). Find the angle \( \beta \) which the thread must form with the inclined plane for the tension of the thread to be minimum. What is it equal to?

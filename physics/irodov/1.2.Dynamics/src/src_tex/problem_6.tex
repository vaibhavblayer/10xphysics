\item The inclined plane of Fig. 1.11 forms an angle \(\alpha = 30^\circ\) with the horizontal. The mass ratio \( m_2/m_1 = \eta = 2/3 \). The coefficient of friction between the body \( m_1 \) and the inclined plane is equal to \( k = 0.10 \). The masses of the pulley and the threads are negligible. Find the magnitude and the direction of acceleration of the body \( m_2 \) when the formerly stationary system of masses starts moving.

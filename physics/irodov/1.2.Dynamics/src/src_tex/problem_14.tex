\item Find the acceleration \( w \) of body \( 2 \) in the arrangement shown in Fig. 1.15, if its mass is \( \eta \) times as great as the mass of bar \( 1 \) and the angle that the inclined plane forms with the horizontal is equal to \( \alpha \). The masses of the pulleys and the threads, as well as the friction, are assumed to be negligible. Look into possible cases.

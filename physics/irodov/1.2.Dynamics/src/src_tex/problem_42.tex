\item A motorboat of mass \( m \) moves along a lake with velocity \( v_0 \). At the moment \( t = 0 \) the engine of the boat is shut down. Assuming the resistance of water to be proportional to the velocity of the boat \( F = -rv \), find:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item how long the motorboat moved with the shutdown engine;
        \item the velocity of the motorboat as a function of the distance covered with the shutdown engine, as well as the total distance covered till the complete stop;
        \item the mean velocity of the motorboat over the time interval (beginning with the moment \( t = 0 \)), during which its velocity decreases \( \eta \) times.
    \end{enumerate}

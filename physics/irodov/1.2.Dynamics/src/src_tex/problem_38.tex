\item A body of mass \( m \) is thrown at an angle to the horizontal with the initial velocity \( v_0 \). Assuming the air drag to be negligible, find:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item the momentum increment \( \Delta p \) that the body acquires over the first \( t \) seconds of motion;
        \item the modulus of the momentum increment \( \Delta p \) during the total time of motion.
    \end{enumerate}

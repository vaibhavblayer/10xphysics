\item A chain of length \( l \) is placed on a smooth spherical surface of radius \( R \) with one of its ends fixed at the top of the sphere. What will be the acceleration \( w \) of each element of the chain when its upper end is released? It is assumed that the length of the chain \( l < \frac{1}{2} \pi R \).

\item A cyclist rides along the circumference of a circular horizontal plane of radius \(R\), the friction coefficient being dependent only on distance \(r\) from the centre \(O\) of the plane as \( k = k_0 (1 - r/R) \), where \( k_0 \) is a constant. Find the radius of the circle with the centre at the point along which the cyclist can ride with the maximum velocity. What is this velocity?

\item A particle has shifted along some trajectory in the plane $xy$ from point $1$ whose radius vector $\mathbf{r}_1 = \hat{i} + 2\hat{j}$ to point $2$ with the radius vector $\mathbf{r}_2 = 2\hat{i} - 3\hat{j}$. During that time the particle experienced the action of certain forces, one of which being $\mathbf{F} = 3\hat{i} + 4\hat{j}$. Find the work performed by the force $\mathbf{F}$. (Here $\mathbf{r}_1$, $\mathbf{r}_2$, and $\mathbf{F}$ are given in SI units).
\begin{solution}
    \begin{align*}
        \intertext{As \(\mathbf{F}\) is constant so the sought work done}
        A &= \mathbf{F} \cdot \Delta \mathbf{r} = \mathbf{F} \cdot (\mathbf{r}_2 - \mathbf{r}_1)\\
        \intertext{or}
        A &= (3i + 4j) \cdot [(2i - 3j) - (i + 2j)]\\
          &= (3i + 4j) \cdot (i - 5j)\\
          &= 17\, J
    \end{align*}

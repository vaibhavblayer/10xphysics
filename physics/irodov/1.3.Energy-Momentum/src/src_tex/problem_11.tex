\item A small body of mass \( m = 0.10 \, \text{kg} \) moves in the reference frame rotating about a stationary axis with a constant angular velocity \( \omega = 5.0 \, \text{rad/s} \). What work does the centrifugal force of inertia perform during the transfer of this body along an arbitrary path from point 1 to point 2 which are located at the distances \( r_1 = 30 \, \text{cm} \) and \( r_2 = 50 \, \text{cm} \) from the rotation axis?
\begin{solution}
    
    \begin{align*}
        \intertext{Centrifugal force of inertia is directed outward along radial line, thus the sought work}
        A &= \int_{r_1}^{r_2} m\omega^2 \, rdr = \frac{1}{2} m\omega^2 \left(r_2^2 - r_1^2\right)=0.20 \, \text{J} \quad (\text{on substituting values}) \tag{1.128}
    \end{align*}
\end{solution}

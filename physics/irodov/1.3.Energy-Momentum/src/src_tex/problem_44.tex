\item A cannon of mass $M$ starts sliding freely down a smooth inclined plane at an angle $\alpha$ to the horizontal. After the cannon covered the distance $l$, a shot was fired, the shell leaving the cannon in the horizontal direction with a momentum $p$. As a consequence, the cannon stopped. Assuming the mass of the shell to be negligible, as compared to that of the cannon, determine the duration of the shot.
\begin{solution}
    \begin{align*}
        \intertext{Velocity of cannon as well as that of shell equals $\sqrt{2gl}\sin\alpha$ down the inclined plane taken as the positive $x$-axis. From the linear impulse momentum theorem in projection form along $x$-axis for the system (cannon + shell),}
        \Delta p_x &= F_x \Delta t \tag{1}
        \intertext{i.e.,\quad $p\cos\alpha - M \sqrt{2gl}\sin\alpha = Mg \sin\alpha \Delta t$ \quad (as mass of the shell is negligible)}
        \Delta t &= \dfrac{p\cos\alpha - M \sqrt{2gl}\sin\alpha}{Mg \sin\alpha} \tag{2}
    \end{align*}
\end{solution}

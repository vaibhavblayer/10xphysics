\item A light non-stretchable thread is wound on a massive fixed pulley of radius $R$. A small body of mass $m$ is tied to the free end of the thread. At a moment $t = 0$ the system is released and starts moving. Find its angular momentum relative to the pulley axle as a function of time $t$.
\begin{solution}
    \begin{align*}
        \intertext{On the given system the weight of the body $m$ is the only force whose moment is effective about the axis of pulley. Let us take the sense of $\omega$ of the pulley at an arbitrary instant as the positive sense of axis of rotation ($z$-axis).}
        \intertext{As}
        M_z(0) &= 0 \\
        \text{so} \quad \Delta M_z = M_z(t) &= \int N_z \, dt
        \intertext{So,}
        M_z(t) &= \int_0^t mgR \, dt = mgRt
    \end{align*}
\end{solution}

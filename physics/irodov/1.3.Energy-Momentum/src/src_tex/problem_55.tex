\item Particle 1 moving with velocity \( v = 10 \, \text{m/s} \) experienced a head-on collision with a stationary particle 2 of the same mass. As a result of the collision, the kinetic energy of the system decreased by \( \eta = 1.0\% \). Find the magnitude and direction of the velocity of particle 1 after the collision.

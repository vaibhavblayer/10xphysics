\item A rocket ejects a steady jet whose velocity is equal to $u$ relative to the rocket. The gas discharge rate equals $\mu$ kg/s. Demonstrate that the rocket motion equation in this case takes the form 
    \begin{center}
        \[
        mw = \mathbf{F} - \mu u,
        \]
    \end{center}
where $m$ is the mass of the rocket at a given moment, $w$ is its acceleration, and $\mathbf{F}$ is the external force.\begin{solution}

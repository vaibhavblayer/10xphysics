A pendulum bob has mass $m$. The length of pendulum is $l$. It is initially at rest. A particle $P$ of mass $\dfrac{m}{2}$ moving horizontally along -ve x-direction with velocity $\sqrt{2gl}$ collides with the bob and comes to rest. When the bob comes to rest momentarily, another particle $Q$ of mass $m$ moving horizontally along +ve z-direction collides with the bob and sticks to it. It is observed that the bob now moves along a horizontal circle. The floor is a smooth horizontal surface at a distance $2l$ below the point of suspension of the pendulum.

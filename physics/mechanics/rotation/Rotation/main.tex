    \textbf{Superposition of waves}
    \begin{quote}
        \textit{When two or more waves travel in the same medium, they are bound to interact with each other. They retain their wave nature after combining with each other, but usually, the resultant wave is different from both of the individual waves. The superposition principle helps us describe the resulting wave or motion that is produced when two or more waves combine with each other. }
